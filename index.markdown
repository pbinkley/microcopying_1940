WEDNESDAY AFTERNOON SESSION

June 5, 1940

The first session of the Conference on Microcopying
Research Materials in Foreign Depositories, sponsored by the
American Council of Learned Societies, was called to order at
two-ten o'clock in Whittall Pavilion, Library of Congress,
Washington, D. C., by Dr. Waldo G. Leland, Director of the
Council.

CHAIRMAN LELAND: Gentlemen, the conference will
please come to order.

The first very pleasant duty is to call upon the
Librarian of Congress, Mr. Archibald MacLeish, to extend the
welcome of the Library to you. Mr. MacLeish!

MR. ARCHIBALD MacLEISH: We are delighted to have you
here and very grateful to you for coming. The necessity for
meeting of this kind I think is so obvious to everyone sitting
in this room that I won't take your time to talk about it,
except to say this, that in all discussions that have in any
way touched microphotography or the use of microphotography or
photo-duplications of any kind, or the relation of libraries to
each other in that field, we here---and by "we here" I mean not
only the Library of Congress but people in Washington, in
communication with Dr. Leland and others---find ourselves coming <span style="page" id="page2">[p.2]</span> back to the realization that until there is some mutual understanding as to what the mechanism is, how it is going to be
used, and how our use of it can be made most effective to
other libraries, there is not very much point in trying to
develop a program. This is basic, and of course is perhaps only
incidental and a footnote to the main purpose of this meeting
which has been so brilliantly expressed in the preliminary
material which the Council of Learned Societies has sent out.
I never have seen a meeting as well prepared as this from the
point of view of the preliminary discussion.

But there is, as I say, a footnote consideration,
which is the consideration of the use of the mechanism, even
in this country and between libraries. What is to be the basis
of use? We here in the Library of Congress, for example, find
ourselves running into the question of the relation of our
work to that of commercial concerns which occasionally suggest
that we are unfairly and improperly competing with them. There
again it is a matter as to which it would be most useful and
most refreshing to have some outside notions, but underneath
it and all through it, I think, lies the question as to whether
it isn't conceivable that a central funding body or directing
body of some kind could be set up so that microphotographic
apparatus in various libraries can be drawn together into <span style="page" id="page3">[p.3]</span> great web which will make the materials of the country immediately flexible and usefully available.

That basic question is the one---I won't say it is the
one we are most interested in, because of course we are tremendously interested in the real project, the large project that
is before you, but believe me, we are desperately concerned
with the answer to that question and it seems to me before we
can go very far, either at this conference or some future conference, there has got to be a decision.

We are delighted to have you here; we are honored that
you have come here to the Library and very appreciative of the
time you have given up for these conferences.

CHAIRMAN LELAND: Thank you very much, Dr. MacLeish,
and at the same time let us thank you on behalf of ourselves
and on behalf of the Council of Learned Societies for the very
hospitable reception that you have given us here, the opportunity that you give us to meet in this beautiful room, and in
a place so appropriate for a meeting of this sort.

I suppose the first thing we should do is to establish
our identities. In other words, we will have a roll call. I
will ask Dr. Daugherty of the staff to call the roll, and I
will ask my colleague, Mr. Graves, to check the list.

CHAIRMAN LELAND: It is very gratifying to the
Council that so many of you should have been able to come to a
conference which, considering its importance and the time of
the year, was called perhaps rather suddenly without adequate
time for preparation. That so many of those that were invited
could come indicates, I think, the great interest which there
is manifested generally in this subject of microfilming, of
mass photographic reproduction of materials for research.

I am very sorry that some who were invited and who
we hoped would be here are not able to be here. Dr. Stevens of
the Rockefeller Foundation had expected to be here but at the
last moment was unable to come. It is quite my own fault that
Mr. Raney of the University of Chicago Library is not here. I
invited him so late that he was unable to make the necessary
arrangements. Mr. McMurtrie who was in Washington yesterday
and who we hoped would be able to be here, was unable to remain
because of other duties that took him elsewhere, and there are
others whom we are sorry not to have with us whose presence
would have added a great deal to the interest of the occasion
and our own information and instruction.

One absence I must note particularly because it is
a permanent absence. Those of you who knew Professor Robert
Binkley, who died a few weeks ago, and who was Chairman of <span style="page" id="page10">[p.10]</span> the joint committee of the Council of Learned Societies and the
Social Science Research Council, realize what a tremendous
vacancy is left by his death. As Chairman of our joint committee, he devoted himself heart and soul to the interests of
that committee; he was the committee, one could almost say.
That is without any lack of appreciation of the work of the
other members of the committee.

It is very largely due to him that we are at the point
where we are now with regard to the use of microfilm and other
devices. He was the one who aroused the interest of scholars
in such things, who convinced them they were feasible devices
which they could learn to use in due time, and he was the
one who interpreted the needs of scholars to technicians, and
I think in general we may say he has had a very important part
in bringing about the growth of interest which results in this
conference. Now that he has left us, we feel indeed that we
have lost someone who was not only a source of great strength,
who was full of ingenious suggestions, and so forth, but someone who was a very wise guide and a delightful companion.

I would like to say a word or two about the purpose
of the Council in calling this conference. In the first place,
why should the Council of Learned Societies call it instead
of some other body? Probably there isn't any good answer to <span style="page" id="page11">[p.11]</span> that except that the Council was very much interested in it,
but the Council does have a very comprehensive range of
interests, from bibliography through the subject matter fields
of social sciences and humanities, and it seemed to be in a
position, a sort of central position, from which it could bring
together a good many different interests, and so the Council
took it upon itself first to discuss the possibility of such
conference with members of the committees of the American
Library Association, of the National Research Council, and of
some of our constituent societies and with other bodies, and
then it was able through the generosity of the Rockefeller
Foundation to secure funds which would make such a conference
possible and also make possible some continuation work of the
conference, and then it prepared its list. The Council realized that a great many projects were under way, that a great
many plans were being made, that these plans were apt to get
in each other's way, that the enthusiasm engendered by the
development of these processes and the unlimited possibilities
they seemed to offer to scholarship and to librarians was
likely in the near future to cause perhaps a congestion of
planning and projects and schemes and so forth, and that it
was highly desirable at this time to see if we could pool our
interests, so to speak, and endeavor to bring some order out <span style="page" id="page12">[p.12]</span> of what threatened to be a very real chaos, and so by bringing
together the agencies most interested in these matters, we
hope some approach to that can be made.

Of course since the plans for this conference were
first laid, some of the conditions which motivated the conference have greatly changed. When we began to talk about preserving materials for research that might be in danger of
destruction, we then thought, I suppose as all the world though
that the war condition was likely to last for an indefinite time
and for some of the most important materials which were not
in imminent danger of destruction at least there would be time
for us to act. Now we realize we were wrong about that;
even if we were not wrong, there was little we could have done.
Even as it is, the destruction may be less than we fear, although optimism with regard to that may be tragically unfounded.
So it is quite likely that we shall have to consider the
necessity of adjusting our plans, of thinking in new terms of
the areas in which those plans can be carried on, perhaps
develop more plans more applicable to the American world, North
and South America, or perhaps more applicable to the peaceful
parts of Europe them to the parts which are now racked by war,
and applicable to the Asiatic world where already some interesting work is being done. At any rate, as we go on we shall see <span style="page" id="page13">[p.13]</span> what the opinion of the conference is with regard to that.

With regard to the purpose of the conference, it
seems to me that it is not to draw any definite plans at the
present time. I doubt if the conference can make final decisions with regard to a great many problems, but I do hope that
the conference can lay a foundation in sound policies and indicate the ways in which those policies can be applied. In other
words, it is a rather general problem that I think we have to
consider at this time, leaving the development of that problem
leaving the application of the principles that may be determined upon here, to a continuing body that for lack of a
better name we will call a Continuation Committee. So after
this conference, or perhaps during it, there will be appointed
a Continuation Committee which will be asked to carry on the
work of the conference, to assume the responsibility in the
name of the Council of Learned Societies and in the name of
other bodies which are interested in the work, to assume responsibility for coordination of plans and for actually setting
on foot, possibly, a good many projects which ought to be
undertaken.

That Committee will undoubtedly have a very important task to perform. Its duties will be heavy, without any
doubt. But it will be an exceedingly important task and I am <span style="page" id="page14">[p.14]</span> sure it can command the hearty cooperation of everybody who is
interested.

The Committee will perhaps be chosen a little
arbitrarily. It will be chosen by the Council in consultation
with a good many of you, and it will be announced perhaps at
the session this evening, or certainly by tomorrow morning, so
that those who are to compose it may be thinking in terms of
the future work of the Committee.

At the close of this conference tomorrow noon I hope
the Committee will be able to lunch together and to discuss
its plans for work in the immediate future.

With regard to the procedure of the conference,
advance memoranda have been distributed to you. I hope you
all have received them. Those of you who have not received
all the material that has been distributed can secure it from
Dr. Daugherty. The material consists of the memorandum which
was sent out with the call to the conference; it consists of
thirty or forty pages of memoranda which came in in reply to
that call and which were duplicated and distributed a few days
ago; it also consists of an additional memorandum submitted
by Mr. Bemis; and finally, on the orange colored sheets, the
final agenda headed by the schedule of the meetings. If any
of you do not have all of that material, Mr. Daugherty will be <span style="page" id="page15">[p.15]</span> very glad to supply it to you.

... Announcements regarding dinner at the Cosmos
Club and schedule of meetings ...

CHAIRMAN LELAND (Continuing): Those of you who
come from outside of Washington are invited on your return to
fill out expense accounts which will be distributed to you
by Dr. Daugherty and return them to the Council and you will
then be reimbursed for the expenses of travel and sojourn in
Washington that you have incurred on account of coming to the
conference.

We have to organize this conference by the democratic
process of selecting a Chairman and a Reporter, and the first
thing to do is to call for nominations for Chairman. Do I
hear any nominations for Chairman?

MR. TATE: Mr. Chairman, I nominate Mr. Leland and
Mr. Lydenberg to serve as co-chairmen.

CHAIRMAN LELAND: A very ingenious suggestions which
I welcome with all my heart. Are there any other nominations?

MR. PETTITT: I move the nominations be closed.

CHAIRMAN LELAND: The nominations are closed. Those
in favor will please say "aye"; those opposed will say "no,"
and Mr. Lydenberg, will you please occupy a place here as
Co-Chairman. <span style="page" id="page16">[p.16]</span>

... Mr. H. M. Lydenberg took his place at the table as Co-Chairman ...

CO-CHAIRMAN LELAND: The beauty of an arrangement of
co-chairmen is that one can skip out every once in a while, and
he can also wander about and test the sentiment of the crowd
and come back and report to his collaborator.

Now as for a Reporter, the democratic process can be
trusted up to a certain point but it is not safe to rely on
it too completely. (Laughter) The Council in the responsibility which it assumed for organizing this asks that you accept
its judgment that Dr. Vernon Tate of the National Archives is
the proper person to select as Reporter. If anyone wishes
to nominate him, I will be glad to observe the democratic process to the extent of allowing you to vote upon him.

MR. SIOUSSAT: I nominate Mr. Tate.

CO-CHAIRMAN LELAND: Are there any other nominations?
I hear none. The nominations are duly closed. Those in favor
of Dr. Tate's serving as Reporter will please signify in the
usual manner. Those opposed. Dr. Tate is unanimously and
duly elected Reporter and he will take one of these secondary
chairs and assume his place on the rostrum.

Let me explain that we expect the Reporter to do.
First of all, as you can see a verbatim report is being kept of <span style="page" id="page17">[p.17]</span> these proceedings. That means in the course of time the
Reporter will have a complete verbatim report which he will
then edit and send to you as soon as possible, but not too
soon---a complete report of this conference, a substantial report, which you can use in reporting to your organizations or
which you can treasure as a souvenir of valuable experience if
you like. At any rate, it is the Reporter's task to edit that
after the conference.

In the second place, it is his more arduous task, at
least his more instantaneous task, to keep track of the consensuses of opinion as they seem to establish themselves, and
at the end of each section of the agenda, or perhaps the end
of each session, to tell us what in his opinion the general
agreements are. If you disagree with the general disagreements,
then of course you have ample opportunity to disagree with them
and the Reporter will stand corrected or he will make notes
to that effect, but in that way I think we shall get along,
carrying our findings and conclusions along with us, so to
speak, and that seems to me to be a better device than appointing a committee which would have to meet at luncheon and at
the end of luncheon ask someone to present the conclusions
of the committee.

I think now we are fully organized except for the <span style="page" id="page18">[p.18]</span> appointment of the Continuation Committee. As to that, announcements will be made later.

So now we come to the agenda. We must adopt the
agenda, of course. This agenda has been drawn up tentatively
and I ask if it meets with your approval, if you think it
presents a workable order of exercises along which you can proceed. Are there any addition which should be made to it?

MR. TILLEUX: You have already told us that the
recent trend of events in Europe may change the direction of
our thinking in terms of North and South America or Asia or
other parts of the world. If we do remain constant in our
idea of bringing materials out of Europe, do we not need to
place on the agenda some discussion of barriers offered bý
censorship. In other words, we can send to Bibliothèque
Nationale an order for materials, but when they get to the
frontier will they stop there? What assurance is there that
they will reach us?

CO-CHAIRMAN LELAND: That is an important point and
should be taken into consideration when we come to discuss the
question of where we shall work, where these operations shall
be carried on, and I think we will do well to bear that problem in mind, and I hope Mr. Tilleux will take the opportunity
of discussing it at that time. <span style="page" id="page19">[p.19]</span>

MR. BEMIS: Is this "Preliminary Memorandum" what
you mean by agenda?

CO-CHAIRMAN LELAND: No, this agenda was distributed
to you only a few days ago. I am inclined to think the agenda
is flexible enough so it can allow for departures, modifications, accretions, and so forth as we go along, and unless
there are other additions to suggest, we may perhaps regard it
as serviceable and proceed along the lines indicated in it.

MR. BEMIS: Mr. Chairman, I suggest it might be well
to allocate time periods for each of these.

CO-CHAIRMAN LELAND: Perhaps so. I hadn't thought
of establishing a time schedule. It is easier to do that after
we get into a thing a little than at the very beginning, but
I thought that Chapter I, Existing Agencies, Facilities and
Plans, can be got through rather rapidly, that No. II will take
us rather longer, No. III will take us rather longer, and IV
perhaps can be disposed of a little more rapidly, because
after all, all we can do now is discuss the rather general
aspects of it. The details have got to be left to the
Continuation Committee. No. V will require some deliberation,
but there again it has to be left to the Continuation Committee
and so with No. VI. I think if we remember all through this
that this conference is not going to solve all the problems, is <span style="page" id="page20">[p.20]</span> not going to find all the answers, and is not going to set
up a definite plan of work, but is rather going to discuss
general principles and procedures and policies and practices
that will be useful for a Continuation Committee to consider,
and the conference will serve as an exchange of views with
regard to rather general matters, that we shall get along more
expeditiously than if we try to establish a definite plan
with specific projects in this conference. That is going, to
be the work of the Continuation Committee which may continue
for a long time and probably will continue for a long time and
will be aided by sub-committees and be aided by additional
members and the various organizations that it will represent.

As an experiment, let's try out Mr. Bemis' plan.
If we say we will devote fifteen minutes to Chapter I on
Existing Agencies, Facilities and Plans, we will see whether
the time schedule is going to work.

I believe now that everything has been covered that
I thought should be covered, unless there is any other business. Other business can be brought up at any time, if you
like. I will rule it can be considered at any time between
sections of the agenda.

The first question that we are asking ourselves here
is: What are the major existing agencies and facilities for <span style="page" id="page21">[p.21]</span> microphotography in the United States and in foreign countries?
This is a rapid gathering of information. Some of those of
course have been indicated just by way of example in the
preliminary memorandum. Others have been indicated in considerably more detail in the additional memoranda that were
sent out to you. I should like very much to have any suggestions made now as to agencies which are important agencies
and that we must bear in mind. Particularly, I think one thing
we want to know is at what universities are special microfilm
projects set up? At what universities have special facilities
been provided so that they are carrying on work in this much
beyond the usual work, the normal work of a university in providing copying service? We know of course that at the University of Chicago there is a major project.

MR. FUSSLER: I wonder if you won't find most of this
data already compiled in the Journal of Documentary Reproduction.

CO-CHAIRMAN LELAND: Yes, I was going to refer to
that as a source of material about much of which we are discussing.

MR. MILAM: I think Mr. Fussler might name those
universities. He knows all of them.

MR. FUSSLER: That is depending on my memory more <span style="page" id="page22">[p.22]</span> than is warranted. Certainly the larger universities at present
are equipped to more or less extent. That would include
Columbia, Harvard, Yale, Brown, Chicago, Wisconsin, Iowa, Virginia, and so forth; some on the West Coast; Temple University.

MR. BOYD: University of Alabama.

MR. FUSSLER: The mere naming of the institutions
will not of course mean that the services are comparable, but
there is something there.

CO-CHAIRMAN LELAND: Are there any others?

MR. POWER: There is the University of Minnesota
and my own organization at the University of Michigan which
is really their photographing department, and in that same
connection, and while I am saying something about it, I thought
we ought to say something about the facilities which we have
abroad, and which I assume is included in this question, is
that right?

CO-CHAIRMAN LELAND: I thought we would first discuss the facilities in this country and then the facilities
abroad.

MR. SCHWEGMANN: May I amplify that list a bit
of the services available: Library of Congress, National
Archives, Bibliofilm Service, University of Chicago, Brown,
Columbia, Harvard, University Microfilms, Yale, University of <span style="page" id="page23">[p.23]</span> Virginia, University of Wisconsin, Temple University, University
of Alabama. No doubt there are several others.

MR. TATE: Vanderbilt, for one, California, University of Texas, Historical Society of Pennsylvania. There
are a number of historical societies in the country that have
facilities: Peabody, for example, State Archives of Illinois,
University of New Mexico, Huntington Library.

MR. VANDERBILT: May I ask if there is contemplation
that a further list of that kind be published? If not, I
think it would be highly desirable to make a complete list of
all photographic facilities available in the country.

MR. TILLEUX: There is, I believe, in the June issue
for 1939 of the Journal of Documentary Reproduction a rather
complete list of universities which have these facilities. They
also list some private organizations, Holbrook, Microfilms of
New York, the Graphic Service Company of Boston, and some
company in Indianapolis, Indiana, the name of which escapes
me at the present time. They are springing up like mushrooms
and you have to keep a loose-leaf list.

MR. CARRUTHERS: I might mention the Library of
the Hispanic Society in New York which provides films and
photostats.

MR. SIOUSSAT: Isn't it dependent on what you mean <span style="page" id="page24">[p.24]</span> by the word "major," Mr. Chairman? Your agenda calls for
the major existing facilities for microphotography. If you
are going to include minor ones, the list could be almost
indefinitely extended.

I have here a letter Just received a few days ago
from Professor Jenkins of the University of North Carolina,
and the significant sentence is just this: "I am doing this
work"---which is a very considerable project---"microfilming
the early sessions of the Legislatures of the States, in
cooperation with the microphotography facilities of the library."
That hasn't been mentioned at all.

I wish to make only one comment. In this case, as in
several others, I think a question bobs up right away in Part I
which really carries over into Part 2 and Part 3. That is to
say, are we looking forward in asking these questions, in going
over this list, to the continuation of interchange of information all the time, year after year, about both agencies and
plans? That would perhaps come under No. 3, but it is raised
immediately by your question.

CO-CHAIRMAN LELAND: Quite right. Mr. Stewart, you
have been doing a survey lately.

MR. STEWART: Yes. I think all the major ones have
been mentioned. I have in my office some material which I can <span style="page" id="page25">[p.25]</span> give the Reporter, a supplementary list which would include a
number of minor ones which haven't been mentioned. I can't
add anything right now.

CO-CHAIRMAN LELAND: This is a form of information
we should like very much to see kept current, and doubtless in
the Journal of Documentary Reproduction there will be published
from time to time a list of both the major and the minor
plants and facilities that are provided in universities and
libraries and in private hands.

MR. TATE: Mr. Chairman, it is rather hard to distinguish between "major" and "minor" when you are compiling a
list.

CO-CHAIRMAN LELAND: Perhaps it would be better not
to try to make that invidious description, but a descriptive
note of the operations and the scope and purpose of them
perhaps would enable the reader to classify in his own mind
as to whether they were major or minor.

MR. MacLEISH: From the point of view of any central
organization that might perhaps be set up to control operations
in this country, it is very important indeed that there should
be a census of apparatus, with some notion as to its capacity.
For example, if there were set up in connection with the Union
Catalogue of the Library of Congress (to imagine a possible <span style="page" id="page26">[p.26]</span> situation) a central finding unit through which requests were
filed and out of which they were forwarded, it would be
absolutely essential to know what depositories had facilities
and what they were. I should think a very useful suggestion
that might come from this conference would be a suggestion
that all institutions which do come under the general scope
of this inquiry might wish to file within whatever central
body is designated a description of their facilities.

CO-CHAIRMAN LELAND: I think that would be a very
good suggestion. I wonder if that isn't the line we had
better take. At any rate, it seems desirable to gather and to
keep on hand current information, up-to-date information with
respect to facilities of this sort. I wonder, then, if
that doesn't clear us so far as the United States is concerned.

Now with regard to facilities abroad, the important
part of that for us if we are contemplating operations abroad
is to know what facilities already exist there. We won't
wish to duplicate them but to utilize them. Those of you who
have followed that can give us some indication as to where the
most important apparatus is located and places that are prepared to fill orders from foreign countries. Mr. Power, you
have made a very recent study of that.

MR. POWER: This last summer I was abroad for that <span style="page" id="page27">[p.27]</span> very purpose, for the dual purpose of finding out what
facilities were available and also for the purpose of setting
up facilities where they were not available. At the present
time the services in England are fairly complete. The British
Museum, Bodleian, Cambridge University, the University of
Edinburgh, all have photographic equipment. I think that
also goes for Durham University. On the Continent it is not
as well developed perhaps as in England but we did have an
agent in Holland that was capable of traveling around with
portable equipment to go to various libraries and to copy the
materials which he wanted. What has happened to him, of
course, no one knows. Also the University of Leyden did have
equipment just shortly before the invasion of Holland.
In Belgium the Royal Library had a photographic department
which used a Leica camera with which they were able to produce
microfilm of pretty fair quality. In Paris the Bibliothèque
Nationale has a complete library, as does the Chemical
Association in Paris, the Maison de La Chimie. In Switzerland
the International Labor Office has a camera which is available to travel around throughout Switzerland.

In Italy the Vatican has a camera of mine which
they operate and which is portable and this past summer
an operator traveled over Italy collecting microfilms of <span style="page" id="page28">[p.28]</span> manuscript material for the Library of Congress and the Modern
Language Association.

In Germany the situation looked very promising in
that they expected to have cameras in the principal libraries,
and thus eliminate inter-library loans. However, that has
been indefinitely postponed but there is still an organization
operating out of the State Library in Berlin to which books
may be sent on inter-library loan and from which one can
secure film. In a great many of these instances, my own
organization represents these people in the United States
and we have attempted to serve in somewhat the manner in which
Mr. MacLeish mentioned, that is, as a centralized spot or place
to which American scholars might well send their orders, inasmuch as we had a little more information than the individual
himself.

CO-CHAIRMAN LELAND: That is very interesting information about the European facilities.

Mr. Leonard, do you recall offhand what institutions
have received special assistance from the Rockefeller Foundation for the provision of facilities of this sort?

MR. LEONARD: Bodleian and Kings College received
some support. I believe that is about all. I am not sure.

CO-CHAIRMAN LELAND: Is there any other information <span style="page" id="page29">[p.29]</span> in regard to the important facilities existing in Europe?

MR. TATE: I can add a few, Mr. Chairman. The F.I.D.
at The Hague has German equipment, or had; I don't know what
the situation is now. There is an installation at the Royal
Library in Stockholm. There is another at the Danish Archives
in Copenhagen, and there is still another at Oslo, at the
University Library under Dr. Munthe. I think those are the
principal ones I know about.

CO-CHAIRMAN LYDENBERG: Does anyone know anything
about Russian equipment?

MR. TATE: They were interested at one time but I
don't think they did more than a little some years ago.

CO-CHAIRMAN LYDENBERG: I recall, I think, some
films coming out of Russia, although I am not certain.

CO-CHAIRMAN LELAND: Mr. Graves, do you know anything

MR. GRAVES: No.

MR. POWER: E. V. Pratt of the National Microfilming
Company did sell the Russians a camera.

MR. BEMIS: Some ten years ago the Russians were
doing a great deal of work; I remember particularly in Berlin
at that time they were photographing police records of
Communists who had been arrested in Berlin in previous years,
and treasuring those documents in their archives. <span style="page" id="page30">[p.30]</span> CO-CHAIRMAN LELAND: Very practical people, the Russians!

Mr. Graves, you were up a moment or two ago. We
haven't mentioned Asia. You know I suppose better than
anyone except Mr. Hummel and Mr. Swingle what provision there
is in China.

MR. GRAVES: First of all, before you get out of
Europe, there was a machine in the Historical Institute in
Prague, and just before the Germans went in, Mendle, the
Director of the Institute, wrote me that he had put 9,000
pages of the Bohemian archives on film. Whether that is
available, or whether it was even at that time available to
people outside of Europe, I don't know, but that was a new
development.

In Peiping at the Peiping Union Medical College
now there is a Draeger high-speed apparatus which is about
ready to begin to operate. On December 11 they said they
would be operating in thirty days, and our assumption now is
that it is in operation. We have sent film and chemicals
over to them. There seems to be no reason why one can't
get copies now of anything that is in any Peiping library.
Presumably that will be kept in touch with by the Division of
Orientalia of the Library of Congress, but the system hasn't <span style="page" id="page31">[p.31]</span> been worked out yet.

Besides that, the chief of the India collection
in the Library of Congress has taken a portable machine with
him to India where he now is, and plans to leave it in a
depository in India which will assume the responsibility for
caring for it and supplying microfilm materials from such
other depositories in India as it is able to get them from.

There must be something in Japan, but I don't know.

MR. BEMIS: All I know is that Japan for ten years
back has been doing quite a little work. Whether it is by the
government or by Japanese scholars, I am unable to say, but
I remember they were at The Hague photographing Dutch records.

CO-CHAIRMAN LELAND: Yes, the Cabinet of Tokyo
had a commission in Europe for a long time seeking documents
of interest to the Japanese. That operated with the advice
of the Committee on Far Eastern Studies.

MR. SCHWEGMANN: One of Dr. Seidell's camera has
been in Japan for about nine months.

MR. SWINGLE: I was going to say the same thing.
It can be used and we can undoubtedly get certain easily
available material from Japan.

CO-CHAIRMAN LELAND: Mr. Seidell, do you have any
other cameras scattered around in far parts? <span style="page" id="page32">[p.32]</span>

MR. SEIDELL: No other far parts. I have one in
England, although it hasn't been used yet.

CO-CHAIRMAN LELAND: Have you any in Paris?

MR. SEIDELL: About eight there.

MR. WATSON DAVIS: In Paris there is equipment in
the Maison de La Chimie, and also at the National Council of
Scientific Research. I don't know what the facilities are
there, but they are ordering microfilm.

MR. TATE: There is a camera at Poona, India, in the
Government Registry Office.

CO-CHAIRMAN LELAND: Do we know anything about South
America and where apparatus is installed there?

MR. BEMIS: Yes, we have an apparatus for microfilming and photostating at Archivo General de la Nacion
in Buenos Aires, they have a photostat machine in the
Bibliotheca Nacional in Rio de Janeiro, and they were about to
put one in the National Archives in Chile. Whether that has
actually been installed, I am not sure. I don't know of any
others in South America.

CO-CHAIRMAN LELAND: Mr. Leonard, have you any
other information about South America?

MR. LEONARD: No; there is none yet in Chile.

MR. SWINGLE: Mr. Chairman; I might say a word about <span style="page" id="page33">[p.33]</span> the work of the Bibliotheca Nacional in Rio de Janeiro.
The director there showed me some of their work and he made
a photostat in my presence to show me how it looks. It is
transparent. You put it in the machine to print directly on
sensitive paper and if there is something on the other side, it
shows through slightly. They made a good many of them, and
they were very much interested in the work that I had brought
with me for my own use. Of course, the Bibliofilms created
a very great interest, both in the library and at the Department of Agriculture there, and the projection machine was
purchased for the new National School of Agriculture some forty
kilometers west of Rio. They were quick to appreciate the
importance of it.

CO-CHAIRMAN LELAND: We have had a rapid swing
around the world.

MR. BUCK: Is there equipment in Canada? The
Public Archives does a good deal of photostating. Do they have
a microfilm apparatus? 

MR. TATE: Not yet.

MR. BUCK: Didn't you say there was one in Mexico?

MR. TATE: No, only a possibility of getting a man
who does a certain amount of work there. There is a camera
there but it is not available generally. <span style="page" id="page34">[p.34]</span>

MR. POWER: There is one at the Library of Toronto,
I know.

MR. TATE: I will take back what I have just said.
There is a camera in the Department of Foreign Relations in
Mexico but it was bought for the Mexican governmental use and
is not available for foreign use.

MR. BUCK: I think there is a microcamera in
South Africa.

MR. TATE: Yes, in Capetown, a Leica.

CO-CHAIRMAN LELAND: At least that gives us
volume of information to start off with, and we have a little
better idea than we first had of the distribution of the
apparatus.

No. 2 is, "What major projects have been completed,
are in progress, or are definitely planned, with support
assured?" Not, what projects are being dreamed about, but,
what projects have been carried out or are going on or are
planned with support assured.

I don't know whether it is desirable to devote very
much time to that. We know of such projects as Project A
of the Library of Congress, and we know of the great newspaper
project carried on by the University of Chicago and the
American Library Association, and the work of the Maison de <span style="page" id="page35">[p.35]</span> La Chimie in Paris, and there are others that are being carried
out. At Brown there is a new laboratory. Mr. Roosen-Runge,
what are you actually doing there now?

MR. ROOSEN-RUNGE: The main work is to complete
the Mathematics Library and to give service to mathematical
reviews and the new Mathematical Abstract Journal. That work
is being supported by the Rockefeller Foundation.

CO-CHAIRMAN LELAND: It has to do chiefly with that,
then, and it is not prepared to undertake other work?

MR. ROOSEN-RUNGE: Yes, it is, but that is the main
work going on now.

MR. SIOUSSAT: I can give you the specific figures
for the Modern Language Association for the past year if you
so desire.

CO-CHAIRMAN LELAND: You mean the old Rotograph
Service?

MR. SIOUSSAT: No, I mean the microfilms.

Sixty microfilms and two rotographs from Great Britain: Forty-three from the British Museum, 12 from the Bodleian,
one from the Victoria and Albert Museum, one from Durham,
one from Cambridge University, one from Gonville and Caius
College Library at Cambridge, and one from Emanuel College.

Fifty-eight microfilms from France, divided between <span style="page" id="page36">[p.36]</span> the Bibliothèque Nationale, 38; Bibliothèque de l'Arsenal, 7;
Bibliothèque de la Sorbonne, 1; the Archives de la Comédie
Française 8, and the municipal libraries at Avranches, Metz,
Rouen, and Tours, 1 film each.

From Germany, seventeen microfilms and one rotograph:
from the Preussische Stattsbibliothek at Berlin, 3; the
Universitäts-Bibliothek at Freiburg, 10; the Nationalbibliothek at Vienna, 3; the Universitäts-Bibliothek at
Göttingen, 1; and the Staats- und Universitäts-Bibliothek at
Breslau, 1 rotograph.

Nine microfilms from Belgium, from the Bibliothèque
Royale at Brussels.

Five from the United States.

Two from Sweden, from the Kungl. Bibliothek at
Stockholm.

One rotograph from the Biblioteca Laurenziana at
Florence, Italy.

One from The Netherlands, one from Switzerland and
one from Australia. That is in the Modern Language Series.

In the second group, the Council of Learned Societies: three rotographs and one microfilm from Great Britain;
four rotographs and one microfilm from the Bibliothèque
Nationale; eight rotographs and one microfilm from Germany;
four rotographs from Italy, and three rotographs from Denmark. <span style="page" id="page37">[p.37]</span>

CO-CHAIRMAN LELAND: Thank you. That shows the production during the year of one of the continuing projects,
started by the Modern Language Association and maintained in
cooperation with the Library of Congress, which enables individual scholars to place orders for documents they need. They
are loaned to the scholars. They become the property of the
Library of Congress and are kept in a pool here where they
are catalogued and can be loaned out under proper conditions
to those who want them.

That can be considered as a whole a source for securing individual documents needed by individual scholars for the
specific purposes and for the most part those are small
orders. Some of them may be only for a few pages; some of them
for two or three hundred pages. In the sort of thing that is
being done they don't require high-speed machinery and they
aren't the sort of large-scale project that, for example,
Project A was.

Mr. Power, you maintain a somewhat similar service
for securing on order documents or materials that are needed
by individual scholars. Suppose before we go any farther we
see if we know any other services of just that sort that are
being set up or that are in operation, service for taking
orders from individual scholars for material that they need, <span style="page" id="page38">[p.38]</span> securing the photographic reproductions of those materials
and servicing them to the scholars who have requested them.
Are there any others?

MR. WATSON DAVIS: The American Documentation
Institute is servicing perhaps well over a thousand such other
per month.

CO-CHAIRMAN LELAND: You deal largely with the sciences
don't you?

MR. DAVIS: Not only sciences, but all fields.

CO-CHAIRMAN LELAND: Are the majority of your requests in the fields of the sciences?

MR. DAVIS: The majority are because of the libraries
that are served by the Bibliofilm Service of the American
Documentation Institute---the Library of the Department of
Agriculture, the Army Medical Library, the Geological Survey
Library, the Library of the National Bureau of Standards---and then of course we are servicing very effectively through
borrowing books many other libraries in Washington. I might
also add that since we receive a good many orders which can
be supplied most effectively by the Library of Congress quite
informally but with effectiveness, those orders are transferred there and filled so that the ultimate object which
we are interested in is that the service to the scholar and the <span style="page" id="page39">[p.39]</span> scientist is fulfilled satisfactorily.

CO-CHAIRMAN LELAND: That is a service, then, for
securing copies of materials which are in large part in
Washington libraries.

MR. DAVIS: Yes.

CO-CHAIRMAN LELAND: Whereas, the service that
Mr. Sioussat is describing is for securing materials that are
in foreign libraries.

MR. DAVIS: In addition to that, when we have had a
request, we have been quite successful, sometimes directly,
sometimes with the help of the State Department, in securing
materials which individual scholars have not been able to secure in foreign depositories. One that I happen to remember involved material in Leningrad. It is true that did not come in
the form of a microfilm but came in the form of photostats, but
from the standpoint of serving the individual who wants to use
the material, I don't
think there is very much difference in
the exact form of the material. In fact, in this particular
case since the preference of the individual was for microfilm,
we turned the photostatic material into microfilm at the request of the person who ordered it.

There is one other project which I would like to
mention, that is the sets of journals that are out of print <span style="page" id="page40">[p.40]</span> or difficult to obtain which have been provided by the American
Documentation Institute through a grant of the Committee on
Scientific Aids to Learning of the National Research Council,
which is a long-term copy project.

MR. POWER: In your preliminary memorandum you mentioned something about English books before 1640. I don't
know whether everyone here knows it or not but we are already
engaged in photographing books printed in England up to 1550 and
have recently managed to extend that through 1600, with the
hope that if the subscribing libraries want it, we will go on
through 1640.

Then there is another project which Mr. Lydenberg
mentioned in his reply, namely, the American periodicals prior
to 1800 and a selected list of books on American culture from
the Columbus Letter through the same date. All of those are
self-supporting in themselves and don't need any help from
outside.

CO-CHAIRMAN LELAND: We have developed two kinds of
enterprises, one for doing, let us say, short orders for
individual scholars, securing notes, and the other which are
large-scale enterprises, securing large bodies of material of
a specified sort which are subscribed to by libraries rather
than individual scholars. Before we leave that point, I should <span style="page" id="page41">[p.41]</span> like to know if in addition to the three agencies available
for short orders, Mr. Powers, the Library of Congress and the
American Documentation Institute, there are any other agencies
that receive requests from scholars and fill those requests
for materials from foreign depositories. Let's say foreign
depositories because we are thinking in terms of securing
material from abroad. Apparently not. No one seems to know
of any others. It seems those three are the chief agencies
that handle small orders from individual scholars. That is
very interesting: the Modern Language Association dealing
mostly in literature and for the modern field, and Mr. Davis
dealing rather largely with demands from scientists, and Mr.
Power meeting general demands, demands of all sort but largely
in the field of literature, isn't that true?

MR. POWER: Perhaps, yes, but it covers anything anybody wants.

CO-CHAIRMAN LYDENBERG: Mr. Chairman, in that
connection have we in this country a center of information
about the nearest point of help for appeals from out-of-the-way places and for material in out-of-the-way places? Is the
Journal of Documentary Reproduction, for instance, able to
tell us where is the best place to turn to for something in
Bucharest, or in this country if one of the smaller <span style="page" id="page42">[p.42]</span> universities wants something in another part of the country.
Where can we find out what is the most expeditious and reliable
source to turn to?

CO-CHAIRMAN LELAND: That is not a rhetorical question, is it?

MR. TATE: Mr. Chairman, the Journal tries in so far
as possible to supply such information, but it is more or less
handled on an informal basis. In many cases we refer questions
to sources which we know or believe to have access to the
material. I believe also the Library of Congress gets a considerable number of requests, and I know the New York Public
Library must, as well as a great many other sources. The
tendency is for people to write to their research library in
their immediate vicinity. The question then may be relayed
half a dozen times before the final information is reached.
There is no organization center.

CO-CHAIRMAN LYDENBERG: Would it be fair to the
Journal to say it was willing to act as a focus for such
requests, granting that they have not been able to be answered
at the point of first attack?

MR. TATE: The Journal would be willing to do so.
Unfortunately, the Journal is not overly burdened with clerical
assistance and the mechanical problem of answering those queries <span style="page" id="page43">[p.43]</span> is quite a considerable one.

CO-CHAIRMAN LELAND: We have developed another need,
haven't we, Mr. Lydenberg, and think it ought to go to the
Continuation Committee.

MR. DAVIS: To a very large extent the American
Documentation Institute in a practical way is serving that need
That is, in a very large number of instances where the request can't be filled in this city, we do forward it to a
library that we are confident does have both the material desired and the facilities. I would like at some appropriate
time during these sessions briefly but with emphasis to put
forth the idea that we should have a cooperating microfilm network which would effectively do this job without any particular
control by the central agency of the integral units in the
network, but with the idea of making effective contribution
to scholarship and scientific research.

CO-CHAIRMAN LELAND: Wouldn't you be willing to put
that in the hands of the Continuation Committee in the form
of a memorandum, Mr. Davis?

MR. BEMIS: Mr. Chairman, in answer to the Co-Chairman's question, I think, Mr. Lydenberg, we touch here a
problem of all our work, at least so it appears to me as a
student of history with some experience in getting these <span style="page" id="page44">[p.44]</span> photostats of documents relating to the history of the United
States to be found in foreign archives. All of that work was
possible because of the larger work with which you, yourself,
are so familiar, the work of the Carnegie Institution of
Washington, the Division of Historical Research, in preparing
guides to material relating to American history in European
archives. Those guides seem to be the real basis for any large
program of reproduction of material, and I very much doubt
whether anything of a large scope is practical unless such
guides are prepared beforehand. The guides, once they are
prepared under adequate sponsorship, then are printed and
circulated generally throughout the whole field of historical
study, become well known, and through reports to the Library of
Congress it also becomes known that the local copies are available here and through the inter-loan facilities available
elsewhere.

It raises the question whether for any large-scale
program the preparation of guides isn't really a fundamental
step, and I suggest that that has been proven by the work of
which you are so familiar yourself, Mr. Chairman.

CO-CHAIRMAN LELAND: I think that is a point we have
got to consider very carefully indeed. I judge it is going to
come up perhaps for fuller consideration under Chapter IV, <span style="page" id="page45">[p.45]</span> Problems of Selection of Material, and especially under 12,
"What are the most practical methods of selection?" so I judge
we shall have an opportunity to discuss that more fully at
that time, but I think it would be well to bear it in mind
from the very beginning.

MR. SIOUSSAT: That is with regard to the future,
whereas No. 3, to which we are now coming, reads, "What are the
chief results of the experience thus far acquired?"

CO-CHAIRMAN LELAND: I suppose Mr. Bemis would
offer that as one of his experiences, that you have to have
a guide of some sort.

MR. CARRUTHERS: Along the line of available facilities for microfilming and photostating, I am very desirous
that the forthcoming Union List of Serials will have some
kind of designation as to where microfilming can be secured,
such as the Abstract Service has at the present time. If
we at the New York Public Library do not have a periodical
and cannot supply it, we have a form letter which goes out
saying where they can obtain the material, or at least where
they are most likely to be able to get it.

MR. TILLEUX: If I might return to one point mentioned by Mr. Lydenberg a while ago, most of us know where we
can find material when we want it, but when we take into <span style="page" id="page46">[p.46]</span> consideration the student working on a Master's dissertation
perhaps in Southwestern Nevada, he may not know where that
material is available, and that is the type of person who
needs it badly, and usually when he asks for it is when he has
exhausted every command at his disposal. It seems to me if
these people were to go to Mr. Davis at the Documentation
Institute or any of the private organizations, they would soon
be so flooded with requests that they would, much against their
will, have to turn them away, or else fall into what many
government agencies sometimes find themselves having to do,
of making a brief, noncommittal reply.

When they need help, they need it in detail, and so
where they go is the local public library, and they have people
set up to answer that type of question, reference librarians
who will spend perhaps an hour checking, making investigations,
and it may be that a week later the library will return the
answer the research person has been seeking. Is it too much to
visualize that the work that a local library does for local
people can be handled nationally for the people of the
country? I know that Dr. Evans of the Library of Congress
and other members of the staff here have been thinking in terms
of national assistance and the larger program of the library.
They are supported by taxes and that is what the tax money is <span style="page" id="page47">[p.47]</span> for, and they can render an assistance to scholars generally
that the individual business organizations cannot afford to
render. Maybe the time is coming when any questions asked by
any person anywhere within the United States can be answered
by some branch of the Library of Congress, some division.

CO-CHAIRMAN LELAND: I thought we had Mr. Haskins
and his newspaper column for that, but perhaps he isn't
sufficient.

Thank you, Mr. Tilleux, I think it is very useful
for us to keep that in mind.

CO-CHAIRMAN LYDENBERG: Mr. Chairman, may I interrupt
a moment and ask Mr. Metcalf if he will not tell us about his
newspaper project. That I think is a continuing project. I
think it is self-supporting, and I am sure it is of real
significance.

MR. METCALF: We have arranged to copy between thirty-five and forty different foreign newspapers currently, a
selection of papers from all over the world. We have a subsidy
of $2,000 a year for two years that has helped put the project
on its feet. We hope after next year it will pay for itself.
We are selling the positive film to any library that wants it
at a little below cost now. We hope it will be at cost by year
after next.

CO-CHAIRMAN LELAND: Do you mean the cost will come <span style="page" id="page48">[p.48]</span> down or the price will go up?

MR. METCALF: Neither, but by selling a few more
copies we can make up the overhead cost that is divided among
the libraries that subscribe. Harvard is buying a copy of
positive film for each of the papers, and libraries throughout
the country are buying copies of a few of the papers. About
200,000 pages a year are being copied. Of course, we do not
know what present conditions are going to do to us and whether
we can continue to get some of the papers. As I said, the
papers come from all over the world: one from Australia, one
from Japan, China, India, South Africa, several from South
America; most of them from Europe.

CO-CHAIRMAN LELAND: I suppose one of the earliest
projects on a large scale was the copying of the hearings of
the Agricultural Adjustment Administration and the NRA, a matter
of a good many hundreds of thousands of pages. It was done
on microfilm and disposed of to libraries at a cost which was
substantial, but which was far less then they would have had
to pay for them under any other circumstances. That was done
as an experiment by the Joint Committee under the direction of
Mr. Binkley, in order to test out his theory that that was an
excellent method of publication.

I wonder, is there kept anywhere any current list of <span style="page" id="page49">[p.49]</span> major projects which are in progress? It is obvious, it
seems to me, that we need to have information constantly on
hand with regard to what is being done. Otherwise, we may be
missing something that is useful to us on the one hand; on
the other hand, these people may get in each other's way. You
notice in his letter Mr. Bishop indicates any library has far
more opportunity to participate in these projects than its
budget will stand for and there is sometimes the embarrassment
of choice.

MR. KELLAR: Mr. Chairman, Mr. Barnes Lathrop of
the University of Texas has been engaged for a year and a half
under the auspices of the University of Texas in microfilming
materials relating to Southern history in a great many collections in this country. That has been going on for a year and
a half and he has copied a good many thousand pages and will
do a good many thousand more.

Another project is the microfilming of American
agricultural periodicals. That will be done by the Readex
Microprint organization which I do not think has been mentioned---the Albert Boni process of microprinting.

Another project which is about to be undertaken
is the microfilming of the British Sessional papers from
1800 to 1900. This is being done by a sub-committee of the <span style="page" id="page50">[p.50]</span> Historical Source Committee of the American Historical Association, of which Mr. Erickson of the University of Illinois is
Chairman.

CO-CHAIRMAN LELAND: Mr. Davies, you started to say
something a short time ago but didn't get recognized.

MR. GODFREY DAVIES: I am not sure what I was going
to say is strictly relevant. I was going to refer to the
Huntington Library project of 1640 books. Six years ago we
started to get one copy of every book printed before 1641. We
started mainly with photostats or originals, whichever seemed
cheapest or most available. Today when a title is a single leaf
or only a few leaves, like a proclamation, we still get photostats. Otherwise, we get microfilm. The thing that struck me
very forcibly when I listened to this discussion is the danger
of a great deal of duplication. So far as I know, no one is
aware of what particular items in 1640 books we have bought;
there are nearly 1000 in number now in one form or another.

One of the things we want, which Mr. Bemis suggested,
and which Mr. Adams suggested in his letter, is a union catalogue
of the 1640 books that are actually available in this country.
It is quite true he wasn't talking about 1640 books, but his
argument is applicable. At the present time I don't think
anybody knows what is available in this country in 1640 books. <span style="page" id="page51">[p.51]</span> My guess would be that in one form or another nearly all of
them are available, and yet very often we write to England
and sometimes elsewhere to get a copy, and maybe there is
copy next door.

CO-CHAIRMAN LYDENBERG: When you get a copy, don't
you send a copy of your catalog card to the Library of Congress

MR. DAVIES: I don't know whether we do that with
film. Of course we would do that with the original book. No,
we don't, but so far we have been short-handed and we haven't
catalogued our film properly. They have lists of them available in the library but we haven't formal cards and they
can't go to the Library of Congress until they are made.

MR. SCHWEGMANN: I was amazed to learn last year
they had photographic copies of all the incunabula.

MR. DAVIES: Not quite all, but the rarest and the
most valuable.

MR. SCHWEGMANN: It is an astounding amount, but
the Union Catalogue does not receive cards of those for the
reasons mentioned. We do receive cards from the Huntington
Library to the extent that they prepare the cards. We have
the lists of the Huntington originals. As a matter of fact,
Huntington Library is one of the most adequately represented
1ibraries in the Union Catalogue, but all librarians are <span style="page" id="page52">[p.52]</span> hesitating about reporting film copies. I am experimenting
now and attempting to isolate cards representing films, and I
assure you that very few are coming in. The New York Public
Library is about the largest producer, in fact it is indisputably the largest producer of cards for microfilm titles.

MR. POWER: To answer Mr. Davies specifically,
the University of Michigan has a project under way under the
direction of Mr. Bishop and supported by the Carnegie Corporation to do the things he mentioned, a census of the 1640 books
within the United States.

CO-CHAIRMAN LELAND: Including the copies?

MR. POWER: I think that will be included---photostatic
copies but not microfilm copies, but it at least will give
them information they want.

CO-CHAIRMAN LELAND: I wonder if there is any
logical reason for distinguishing between the two.

MR. POWER: There is, yes, because this is a by-product of a project already under way. The project is a
loose-leaf bibliography of the contents of those books, and
before they can be photographed it is necessary that they be
located.

CO-CHAIRMAN LYDENBERG: May I withdraw for a
moment as co-chairman and take a place on the floor and ask the <span style="page" id="page53">[p.53]</span> Reporter to note that at some appropriate time I am going
to ask if this organization favors or looks with disinterest
or disfavors a recommendation from us that when libraries
secure reproductions at full-scale or in microfilm of
texts that they believe are important for research, they see
to it that they are charged with the duty of making adequate
cataloguing records of them and furnishing a card to the Union
Catalogue of the Library of Congress.

I don't know that this is the time to consider that.
We are trying to gather facts now but that is something I
may call for later.

MR. BEMIS: The Chairman said business could be brought
up at any time. This has been brought up and I move we adopt
a resolution favoring it.

CO-CHAIRMAN LELAND: It seems to me to fit in here.
You have heard the motion, that this conference recommend to
the Continuation Committee that acquisitions of photographic
copies, whether microfilm or photostat, be reported to the
Library of Congress in the form of cards. Mr. Schwegmann, did
you wish to make an additional remark on that?

MR. SCHWEGMANN: You gentlemen probably remember
about 1928 the Union Catalogue published what was called a list 
of photo-facsimiles in American libraries, about 3,000 <span style="page" id="page54">[p.54]</span> titles, which were then photostated. Since then we have enlarged that list until it now includes about 6,000 titles,
all photostated or rotographed, not microfilmed. I have
wondered for years whether it would be worth republishing in
its enlarged form, but this duplication which is referred to
might be somewhat eliminated if this list were published in its
present form.

In that connection, we systematically search the
Union Catalogue for all indications of facsimiles, whether
microfilm or photostats, and we make a separate file for both.

MR. LONG: Mr. Chairman, inasmuch as these things
have not been reported in the past, wouldn't it be well to
include in the resolution that previous acquisitions of that
sort, as well as current acquisitions, be included?

CO-CHAIRMAN LELAND: I have no doubt the mover and
seconder would agree to that.

MR. SIOUSSAT: Might I suggest it might be well to
take this motion up at a later time, because I think a lot of
things may come up which will throw light upon it which we
might need before we vote to do a certain thing. The resolution might be to make it part of the agenda to be taken up.

I would like to ask Mr. Lydenberg, with your permission, if he puts a card in the New York Public Library <span style="page" id="page55">[p.55]</span> for each individual manuscript.

CO-CHAIRMAN LYDENBERG: No, not in the public catalogue; in the manuscript catalogue.

MR. SIOUSSAT: You don't have it in the public
catalogue?

CO-CHAIRMAN LYDENBERG: No. I was talking about printed texts in the resolution.

MR. SIOUSSAT: I thought that should go in the
record, that the resolution referred to reproductions of printed texts. Your resolution as it was drawn referred to
everything.

CO-CHAIRMAN LELAND: It should refer to books. I
can see where you are leading to. You want to point out the
necessity of doing the same thing for copies of manuscripts,
and then we would have to have a new building.

You have heard the motion. I suppose it really is a
motion to refer to the Continuation Committee, because the
Continuation Committee is the organization that has got to
deal with all these recommendations, and so forth. I
suppose the discussion is terminated on that subject. Those in
favor of the motion of Mr. Lydenberg will please say "aye";
opposed, "no." The motion is carried.

I wonder now if we are ready to ask the Reporter <span style="page" id="page56">[p.56]</span> to sum up his understanding of the discussion of Section I.
We started off according to our time table to give that fifteen minutes, but we have given it an hour.

MR. WATSON DAVIS: Mr. Chairman, at the risk of
prolonging this slightly, I would like to put into the record
the existence of a continuing project, the Auxiliary Publication
Service of the American Documentation Institute, which performs
the unique service of getting into circulation material that
cannot otherwise be published. There exists the unique copy
in the files, and I would like just to bring that into the
discussion because it is a rather new category that should be
given consideration.

CO-CHAIRMAN LELAND: It is understood that Mr. Davis
reports the work of the Documentation Institute in providing
a publication service for materials for which there is
unique copy.

MR. CARRUTHERS: I can't say very much about it now
but I would like to say the New York Public Library will
presently announce a project a few months hence.

CO-CHAIRMAN LELAND: You arouse our apprehension.
(Laughter)

MR. WILLIAMS: Mr. Chairman, I would like to know if
we are going to have the Reporter read the summary of all <span style="page" id="page57">[p.57]</span> of this, including the third subdivision under I, or have
we finished with all the discussion under 3?

CO-CHAIRMAN LELAND: I was going to say while we
haven't really formally taken up No. 3, I think as a matter
of fact all of our discussion of No. 2 has been rather from
the point of view of No. 3.

MR. WILLIAMS: They got crossed up so I wasn't sure
we were on No. 3.

CO-CHAIRMAN LELAND: I am inclined to think that
we are. Let's say we have been discussing No. 3 for some
time without realizing it, and if there is any further discussion of No. 3 before we ask the Reporter to summarize our
conclusions, let's have that now.

MR. WILLIAMS: I am not prepared to make any
recommendation about the proper solution of the problem but
the discussion has brought out the problem under the
heading of existing agencies and facilities and plans that it
seems evident that we have all found difficulty of one sort
or another, and that of course will be resolved in one way
or another by the Continuation Committee, but I should like to
take this occasion to emphasize the fact that the existing
facilities need help or need something, because the process
is too slow. We are doing what we can, it may be just a <span style="page" id="page58">[p.58]</span> trickle in comparison to the larger projects but it seems to
me of the utmost importance to keep that going. I deplore
any move that might cause a famine in order to enjoy a plenty
later on, so far as facilities are concerned, and I would
like to make the plea that something be done, that something
be taken into consideration, for expediting the work already
going on. Sometimes scholars with these specific projects
wait for months before any result is attained, and I have
observed certain private libraries get results on their own
more rapidly than some organizations do. That is just one
aspect of it that I would like to emphasize here.

CO-CHAIRMAN LELAND: You are referring to your
experience in the Modern Language Association Retograph Service,
which is a service for receiving orders or requests from individual scholars and having those requests filled through the
services of the Library of Congress, and that has been supported by contributions from universities, from university
libraries, hasn't it?

MR. WILLIAMS: Yes, sir. The funds are always
available, but the expert supervision that may come out of
this conference should help; that is to say, knowing where
these things may be had, what facilities are available, and
so on. <span style="page" id="page59">[p.59]</span> CO-CHAIRMAN LELAND: One of the difficulties you have
found is to know how to secure them, where they are to be
secured from.

MR. WILLIAMS: I found one private library may know
much more than all of our organizations, just through trial and
error.

MR. TILLEUX: Mr. Chairman, I am afraid that perhaps
the reason we don't know more about the microfilm holdings of
early books in America is because there is that continuing
prejudice on the part of some libraries against anything that
isn't actually in book form. If I am not mistaken,
Mr. Power's University Microfilm Service already supplies libraries cards of the books you have microfilmed. Isn't that true?

MR. POWER: That is right.

MR. TILLEUX: That would apply to titles that you
filmed in England, for example, everything in the Short Title Catalog?

MR. POWER: Yes.

MR. TILLEUX: Immediately that disposes of the
question of whether all of the books in Pollard and Redgrave
are available in the United States. That great mass of data is
already available to us.

MR. POWER: That is also true with any manuscript
we may publish, or any dissertation, any doctoral dissertation, <span style="page" id="page60">[p.60]</span> and the cards are furnished for that, too.

MR. TILLEUX: Mr. Schwegmann has told us about the
list dating from 1928 which is probably confined to the
photostatic copies, but if a union check list of materials
now on microfilm and available in the United States could be
supplemented from time to time, I think that is the sort of
thing that the Historical Records Survey could be worked into
doing in some way under one of its various branches so that
scholars could have this information.

One more thing, and that is the fact that the Works
Projects Administration has been microfilming newspapers
in many sections of the country. I won't go into it further
because we could speak all the rest of the afternoon on the
various ramifications, but we have projects set up to do state-wide microfilming of selected newspapers in the field of
agriculture or religion or various political newspapers. That
is state-wide in the State of Michigan from about 1815, I
think, down to the present.

Then we have a similar project in the University of
Omaha, in Omaha, Nebraska; we have a city-wide project there. We
haven't actually started operating a microfilming project yet
in the State of Tennessee. We have a state-wide project in
Ohio, headed, as you know, by the late Dr. Robert C. Binkley, <span style="page" id="page61">[p.61]</span> which is really our proving ground for that type of work. We
have them suggested all over the country, and whenever project
applications come in for the indexing of newspapers, one consideration which determines whether or not the project shall
be approved is whether or not they are microfilming the newspaper, because in a few years the woodpulp on which the paper
is printed will be destroyed and they will be left with an index that is of no particular service, and if they are not
microfilming, the project application usually gets thumbs down.

CO-CHAIRMAN LELAND: That gives us a list of a good
many more projects that are going on. The world is certainly
full of a number of things.

MR. SIOUSSAT: There are a great many projects of
reproductions of reproductions that we might put in. WPA is
copying a good many in Louisiana and other states, that is
material in the Library of Congress that came from Europe,
doing secondary reproductions on a large scale.

MR. TILLEUX: And your office has also lent to
Florida a number of manuscripts copied abroad.

CO-CHAIRMAN LELAND: Are we ready to have Mr. Tate
summarize the discussion so far? If so, we will ask him to do
that and then we will pass the program over to the Co-Chairman
to deal with No. II. Mr. Reporter, will you summarize your <span style="page" id="page62">[p.62]</span> understanding of the discussion?

MR. TATE: I have here about eight points which seem
to summarize the discussion thus far.

1. It is suggested that lists of sources for obtaining microfilm should be published and made available.

2. A possible census of apparatus in existence in
various parts of the country might be compiled and placed in
Union Catalogue.

3. There are two basic problems under consideration,
namely, copying to individual order for individual use, and
the copying of material in bulk for library use.

4. An information center for questions on microphotography and similar points intended to direct orders to
the place where they can best be filled, was suggested.

5. It was further suggested that any program should
be based on the preparation of suitable guides.

6. It was queried whether there was any current
list of major projects which could be consulted in order to
avoid duplication wherever new projects were being considered.

7. It was resolved to refer to the Continuation
Committee the statement that when librarians secure full-scale
or microphotographic reproductions of important printed texts,
a proper catalogue card should be made out and sent to the <span style="page" id="page63">[p.63]</span> Library of Congress. This was subsequently extended to include
copies made in the past.

8. The last point was that of the need to expedite
the process of getting material on film.

CO-CHAIRMAN LELAND: That is intended simply to remind us of the things that we have gone over in our discussion.
Of course, the Committee will have at its disposal the complete
text of the discussion and will be able to suplement it from
other suggestions that have been made that might not have been
noted by the Reporter.

If there is no objection, and I am sure there will be
no objection to that, I am going to ask my colleague to
assume the responsibility for the next subject.

MR. SCHWEGMANN: I have been going through the
balance of the agenda and I see no other reference to what I
want to bring up under No. 3: What are the chief results of
the experience thus far acquired, and what are the principal
problems revealed by experience? I assume that refers to the
experience we have had with microfilming, end right now is the
time to register a rather vigorous protest against the conduct
of microfilming in the past. For instance, a great deal of
the European archive material in the Manuscript Division of
the Library of Congress is on microfilm. Recently one of the <span style="page" id="page64">[p.64]</span> southwestern universities wanted a positive copy that amounted
to something like 6,000 feet. It was practically impossible to
make a positive copy of that film, for two reasons: first, because it was exposed so poorly that you would have to change
your printing speed I suppose every six inches. Fortunately,
the Library made enlargements of prints of each manuscript,
and we microfilmed the entire thing. In this particular instance
the situation was solved that way. But there has been, not so
much now as formerly, but even now there is too much poor microfilm being put out, poor in the sense that you will never make
a decent copy of it.

I think that situation should at least be brought to
our attention and that very rigid specifications should be adhered to. Specifications themselves are easily enough made,
they are agreed to by everyone, and the thing is to get people
to adhere to the specifications that are recommended.

CO-CHAIRMAN LELAND: I imagine we will come to that
in this next section where we deal with technical problems,
but with regard to the problem you suggested, if they are from
the Foreign office archives in Paris, I saw a good deal of that
being done, it had to be done in daylight, in varying conditions of light, somewhat near a window, and you couldn't
standardize the conditions, you didn't have standard conditions. <span style="page" id="page65">[p.65]</span> That of course must be true of a good deal of photography that
has been done up to the most recent times, that it had to be
done under very unfavorable conditions with varying conditions
of light.

MR. BEMIS: And the character of the documents,
sometimes light or dark, needs a different exposure and it is
a very difficult problem and you shouldn't expect you can give
the same exposure to every cliche on a film.

MR. SCHWEGMANN: Local conditions might differ but
with reasonably adequate equipment, with the $1,000 camera that
is available, better work could be done.

MR. BEMIS: And the use of electricity, and a filter
if necessary---but if they don't have electricity, then what?

MR. SCHWEGMANN: Nine-tenths of the microfilms are
being made where there is electricity.

CO-CHAIRMAN LELAND: This really comes under No. II
and I will turn the meeting over to my colleague, Mr. Lydenberg.

CO-CHAIRMAN LYDENBERG: As usual with anything that
Mr. Leland prepares, the rest of the team merely follow the
path he has indicated.

Our first question is as to the agencies engaged in
continuous study of technical problems. I assume that we
can say that every agency active in microfilm work is engaged <span style="page" id="page66">[p.66]</span> in the continuous study of its technical problems; otherwise
it won't go on. I think that there is no question that every
step you take brings up a new problem as was indicated by
what Mr. Schwegmann brought up, but the Chairman's position is
to preside and not to talk.

MR. POWER: Mr. Chairman, I wanted to talk on
Mr. Schwegmann's point in that we have had considerable difficulty in securing microfilm from Europe that meets with American
standards, but the reason for that is not necessarily due to
the inadequacy of the equipment or the inexperience or inefficiency of the operator. Mr. Leland mentioned one point, the
question of light, and that is often a problem where you do
not have standard electric light sources, as for instance in
London where you have four different types within the City of
London and your camera is wired for only one type. There is
the question of the availability of satisfactory film. Someone mentioned filters, and it is true that does help with
certain types of material, and if your film is panchromatic
and fine enough grain, you can get a satisfactory microfilm.
However, in Italy there is a strict control of film and it is
impossible to secure the best film. The Italian film is not
color sensitive and therefore it does not give satisfactory
results. A similar condition, although not so much, is the case <span style="page" id="page67">[p.67]</span> in Germany where Agfa produced a documentary film, but it
doesn't compare with ours.

MR. BEMIS: I would like to make a point on
that, that the work which the Library of Congress did beginning
eleven years ago has to bear the imperfections of work that
was simply in infancy, and I suggest it is a little bit severe
to hold work done eleven years ago up to the standards of work
which is possible today.

In addition to that, there are a great many other
practical difficulties which only one who has worked in the
field in different foreign countries, in very differing
conditions, can realize.

MR. VANDERBILT: Mr. Chairman, I suggest some of this
technical data may form a part of the catalogue of the microfilm. It may be necessary that it appear on such cards as
it has been suggested be submitted to the Library of Congress;
I mean that those cards shall bear such information as the
condition of the film from the point of view of future reproduction.

MR. TILLEUX: I should like to ask Mr. Schwegmann if
the old films to which he refers weren't produced with
Rockefeller funds in the various archives of Seville, and so
forth. <span style="page" id="page68">[p.68]</span> MR. SCHWEGMANN: I am sorry if my expression gave
rise to a misinterpretation. I was referring mainly to the
production of microfilms today, that is to guide our production
on the basis of what we have learned.

MR. TILLEUX: I know that Dr. Binkley would send you
samples of film from time to time and you had a testing laboratory of some kind here in which those were tested, for permanency, and so forth.

MR. SCHWEGMANN: The Bureau of Standards is most
qualified to do that type of thing. But specifically the
type of thing I meant to refer to is this: Just within the
matter of a year the Library of Congress acquired quite a bit
of music from abroad.

MR. TILLEUX: Where was it developed? Was it developed abroad?

MR. SCHWEGMANN: It was developed abroad and the
evenness of exposure is beyond question, but in this case
they photographed all the versos next to each other, and you
have to skip from the back to read the continuity.

MR. TILLEUX: The idea of economy creeps in there.

MR. SCHWEGMANN: I am speaking not only of the
selection of material and of film, but the manner in which it
is going to be filmed. <span style="page" id="page69">[p.69]</span>

MR. TILLEUX: It points again to the need for
standards, whether it is cellulose nitrate or cellulose acetate
stock.

MR. SCHWEGMANN: I think this was acetate stock. It
was done in Germany.

MR. TILLEUX: If it isn't sufficiently rigid, you
have residual hypo which darkens the film and makes it of no
use for printing purposes.

MR. SCHWEGMANN: I wasn't criticizing what has been
done in the past but simply mentioning this as a guide for the
future.

MR. TILLEUX: May I suggest Mr. Irvin Stewart
on the Committee on Scientific Aids to Learning has been doing
research into various organizations in the country for doing
microfilming and meeting technical problems. He might be
able to give us some help.

CO-CHAIRMAN LYDENBERG: Mr. Stewart, what can you
tell us about what agencies are engaged in a study of the
technical problems connected with microfilming?

MR. STEWART: The best thing I can do is tell you
what we are doing, and probably all the other agencies here can
tell their own stories better than I can. The particular survey that has been mentioned is one we are making for the <span style="page" id="page70">[p.70]</span> Carnegie Corporation. I hope to get a report to that organization by the end of the present month. Some of the information
that came in is confidential in nature but such of it as is not
confidential I should be glad to make available in the raw to
your Continuation Committee if it wants to make an analysis
beyond that contained in the report itself.

As for our Committee, we cannot be considered as
engaged in continuous study of technical problems because we
are a temporary organization and will not be continuous ourselves. We were set up for three years and having lived our
three years, we keep on living, but we are going to die pretty
soon. But before we die, there are four things that we have
under way now as separate projects that might be worthy of
mention.

In a recent issue of the Journal of Documentary
Reproduction there is a section on document reproduction.
Second, Dr. Tate is now preparing, and I hope sometime in the
not too distant future will bring forth, a manual which will
explain to the individual scholar who is confronted with the
necessity of purchasing equipment, of using equipment for
making photographic reproductions, explicit instructions as to
just how to handle all embarrassing questions.

Mr. Metcalf's_committee is going to bring out a <span style="page" id="page71">[p.71]</span> similar report on all other photographic processes, so that
will be disposed of.

We are pursuing a little further the question of
the possibilities of the flat surface microfilm, but unfortunately it will be at least a year before we have anything
to report on that.

We expect there will be on the market by fall a rather simple reading machine that will sell perhaps at $30.

... The reporter was asked to add to the list of
agencies engaged in study of technical problems, the following:
Record Registry Corporation, 912 E. Washington, St., Indianapolis, Indiana, J. Q. Kerrins, President ...

MR. WILLIAMS: Mr. Chairman, I can't refrain from
making another observation here. Of course the European
libraries are behind in the experimental phase of this, I
should say about ten years behind. We know that various up-to-date libraries are establishing laboratory methods of gauging
results, and recently a course in photography was instituted
as an asset to librarianship, and I understand a foundation
in this country invited two European countries to send representatives over here to take the course and provided all expenses to the biggest libraries to send their representatives.
When they were confronted with the proposal that they put on <span style="page" id="page72">[p.72]</span> aprons and go in the laboratory and watch the film go through
the whole process, they disdained the whole thing and refused
to have anything to do with it, and consequently they went back
no better informed on technicalities than when they came. That
is a psychological problem but I think it has to be taken
into account.

MR. KELLAR: One of the questions which I think
should be considered in connection with the technical aspects
of microfilming is the question of proper editing. You look
at the film from the point of view of the consumer. The
film should be very carefully edited. Compiling and editing
together have not, I think, received the attention they should.

I also think that if adequate attention is given to
this, it is going to add considerably to the expense of
filming, because that sort of work has to be done by an expert.

I also wish to say I am in agreement with what Dr.
Schwegmann said about the necessity of keeping very high standards of the technical part of the filming, and I know of many
films in which that has not been done.

CO-CHAIRMAN LYDENBERG: By "editing" you mean undoubtedly a word about the physical condition of the original.
You are not speaking of any editorial changes or comments in
the text. <span style="page" id="page73">[p.73]</span>

MR. KELLAR: Yes, that is exactly what I am referring
to. If you have a newspaper film, I think there should be
sort of preface or short history of the newspaper. You have
changes of editors, changes of titles, matters in connection
with the character of the paper, other data of that sort. Ìn
the actual filming there should be editorial notes with a frame
left to put this in at the proper place, that on such and such
a date the newspaper office burned down and there was no issue
for five days, so that when the scholar gets it, he knows that
is what happened and that there just aren't some copies missing.
Naturally, there is a physical reason for that, and that sort
of data should be included with all filming, so that when the
scholar uses it he has all the data as when he has an edited
document.

MR. BOYD: Mr. Chairman, I merely want to say that is
the process of editing that we followed in the new project for
the filming of the Pennsylvania Gazette from 1728 to 1790. We
wrote a short history of the newspaper, indicating also where
the various copies came from, to fill in the gaps in our file,
set that up in type and filmed it at the beginning of the film.

MR. HILL: I would like to speak to Mr. Schwegmann's
remarks because I had something to do with some of the film
he is talking about, and I realize of course the deficiency in <span style="page" id="page74">[p.74]</span> it.

He mentioned a camera worth $1,000. That is pretty expensive equipment. Mr. Kellar speaks about the editing of
the film, that is, the mechanics that go around it to make the
film intelligible, we might say. We have to do a good deal of
that, and especially with documents you must do it. That
eliminates a good deal of the speed with which you can work,
but the mechanical work which has rather been indicated by the
gentlemen here I think will probably have to be done by photographers that are not Americans. You are not going to send an
expert over there to run this machine.

MR. BEMIS: They won't accept him.

MR. HILL: That is the point, so you have got to consider this from many angles, and you have the difficulty of
the mechanic who is going to use the machine. You can set up
the standard and then put that mechanic on it and he may follow
it, but with documents you have a tremendous variation in
the same group of papers, in the color of your paper which I
believe affects it. I am not a technician on that point but
I think Mr. Tate would bear me out on that point, that there
is a great deal of variation. So you would have difficulty
I think almost eternally with reproducing the film.

With enlargements, which I favor very greatly, you
can turn around and refilm the enlargement and perhaps get <span style="page" id="page75">[p.75]</span> better results that way than by direct reproduction, but there
are a lot of very difficult problems, I can assure you, that
have not been solved simply by perfecting the machinery.

I know when we first began we worked with a simple
Leica camera, the simplest type of apparatus, what the amateur
works with today, but to put in this very expensive apparatus
in some of the countries where they are not only ten years
behind, but a good many more years behind, presents some very
difficult problems that need to be looked into.

MR. SCHWEGMANN: I hate to monopolize the conference
but I seem to have stirred up a hornets' nest. I think the
Rockefeller Foundation got their money's worth when they subsidized the copying of European archives. Fortunately, most of
the film copies have been made into enlargement prints by the
Library of Congress. It is here and we probably couldn't get
it in the future, so I think from the angle of value received,
they got their money's worth.

One thousand dollars is not much to pay for a camera
if you are going to do a lot of work. I think any of us
who are using equipment daily are convinced that a thousand-dollar camera is what we need. I notice Eugene Power has two 
of them. That is a commercial enterprise. He buys a
thousand-dollar camera because he can make more money with it. <span style="page" id="page76">[p.76]</span> It all depends on how many photographs you take. If it is
only a few, by all means the Leica is all right, but if you
have production to get out, the thousand-dollar camera is not
too expensive. So far as the change in color of manuscripts
or newspapers or anything else, I can assure you that day after
day, exposure after exposure, in the New York Public Library
and Power's laboratory, at the end of 100 feet that roll is
just as evenly exposed as though it were uniform copy, provided
proper techniques were used.

The only other thing I want to say is this: Those
are the ideal standards that I have suggested. If we can't
approximate that, then let us not anticipate a good microfilming result. That should have a great bearing on our whole
conversation here. Are we going to get what we know to be
good microfilm today, or are we going to revert back to ten
years ago simply because some European power won't permit an
American technician to enter the country or will not permit
their technicians to be trained to our standards? That training can be had in a very short time, a matter of days or a week.

MR. BEMIS: But where the copy is loaned, you have
to put up with some conditions that I assure you are very trying.

MR. SCHWEGMANN: I don't doubt it, and then you <span style="page" id="page77">[p.77]</span> must expect an imperfect result.

MR. POWER: Mr. Chairman, in that connection Mr.
Schwegmann mentioned that I had two cameras which cost $1000,
which is true, and I also own several of the cheaper cameras
which sell for $300, and it is a better investment for me or
anybody else to buy the more expensive camera which is simpler
in operation and which is more certain of results, whether it
is operated by a native operator or by an American sent there;
it will produce more uniform, better results in the end than
if you take the cheaper equipment, equipment which seems simpler
but which is more complicated in operation.

MR. LAWRENCE MARTIN: I would like to venture this
suggestion to this group. I have the feeling that there are
times when manuscripts are being microfilmed in common with
maps when the microfilming ought to be interrupted, and with a
proper arrangement made, a return to that point should give
us photostating of the maps, because we recognize the very
complicated color combinations are very difficult to get and
we do want enlargements, and I don't see in the present situation a chance of doing anything adequate unless we make provision to have photostats substituted for microfilm on maps at
certain stages.

MR. BEMIS: Suppose there aren't any photostat <span style="page" id="page78">[p.78]</span> machines in the city or the country.

MR. MARTIN: Then we would wait until we could
photograph it.

MR. WATSON DAVIS: I believe microfilm can do anything you need to have done photographically. It is true on
the photographing of long runs it may be necessary to change
film, substitute a color sensitive film, or in the case of
maps where color is a predominant factor it may be necessary to
use color films, which can be done.

MR. MARTIN: Will that stand enlargement?

MR. DAVIS: Oh, yes.

MR. BEMIS: I would like to make one remark here that
I am afraid is all too obvious. No library ought to accept
any collection of films which are inflammable, at least
explosive. There are films that are practically non-inflammable.
An inflammable film, I say, ought not to be accepted, and yet there is a constant temptation, particularly
when sending abroad for films or sending to agencies and institutions, there is a constant tendency for those agencies and
institutions to provide you with ordinary explosive film,
and I am afraid if some of that comes into the best conducted
libraries where the custodians aren't aware of the substitution
it will be fatal, and no more important factor, in my opinion, <span style="page" id="page79">[p.79]</span> can be considered than an insistence upon non-inflammable
film.

CO-CHAIRMAN LYDENBERG: There is no question the
Reporter will take note of that, and as a matter of fact, it
is illegal to store cellulose nitrate except under proper
precaution. How some of us are to distinguish by observation
whether it is cellulose nitrate or acetate is another question.

MR. TATE: Nitrate film has a very distinctive odor.
Once identified, it is very easy. You can just take a few
sniffs and identify it.

MR. WILLIAMS: Mr. Chairman, the Library at Columbia
University tell me in some cases they can get the material
only on the inflammable film but they immediately transfer
it to the other kind and throw away the original.

CO-CHAIRMAN LYDENBERG: Mr. Fussler, may I ask if
at the film laboratory at the University of Chicago you have
made any record of the results of your study and observations
as technical problems have been faced, solved or recognized
as insoluble?

MR. FUSSLER: I don't think we have made any record
other than miscellaneous publications that come from the
University from time to time that have mentioned problems that
we have encountered that certainly have been met in other <span style="page" id="page80">[p.80]</span> laboratories as well.

In connection with this general discussion of the
standard involved in film production, I should like to make
one simple observation that has occurred to me, that much of our
difficulty revolves about the acceptability of inferior to very
bad film by an individual scholar for his immediate purposes,
and its complete unsuitability for institutional use, and I
think much of our troubles have been encountered in that way,
that filming projects have been conducted by individuals
initially for their own purposes and their private study and
those films have then been deposited in the library for consultation by other scholars and general consultation has not
been found satisfactory.

The cost of doing the work in those two different
ways is again not comparable. An individual can set up a
small camera and copy and make what he feels may be quite
suitable reproductions at extremely low cost which any institution would reject, and make copies from similar originals at
perhaps somewhat higher costs.

CO-CHAIRMAN LYDENBERG: I wonder if any of the
operating courses have at any time made notes of the technical
problems that they were faced with, and their solution. If
they have, are those results published? If they are not, is it <span style="page" id="page81">[p.81]</span> worthy of suggestion from us that for the future, for our
followers, some such effort as that be made?

MR. TATE: Mr. Chairman, we at the National Archives
make out for each job that goes through a job sheet which not
only lists the material to be copied, but notes any special
problems encountered, and notes, among other things, the various
film developers, other things used, and those job sheets are
filed for constant reference. We frequently find we have done
a job two or three months ago that is similar to a job that
is coming up at the present time. The results of those sheets
have not been made available generally to anyone except through
correspondence or through publication. I question whether it
would be desirable for anyone to have those unless you
fully understood why we did each thing we did.

In that connection there has been some talk recently
of making up a kind of check-sheet for microfilm copies.
I had a rather unhappy experience with that particular thought
last week. The matter of a check-sheet on quality of microfilm I think is essential, yet the actual composition of the
check-sheet and its universal application is very difficult.
Somewhere there should be a simplified list of tests which
anyone can apply, or at least any reasonably well equipped
establishment can apply, for microfilm, and even further than <span style="page" id="page82">[p.82]</span> that, there should be some basic standards on the production
of film from which positives are to be made which will enable
those tests to be conducted ten years from now if we choose.
I think that is a point that should appear in our notes,
rather as an elaboration of your own.

MR. TILLEUX: Mr. Chairman, with regard to the
standards, the discoveries in the past on the standardization
of various films, I would call your attention to the various
published reports, and probably many that are not published,
of the American Society of Motion Picture Engineers. Long
before microfilm reached its present status, or long before
it was thought of, probably, the various motion picture
engineers of the country were doing their own research, and
much that we know today we can trace back to the findings
they made then. I don't know whether or not all of that
material has been dug out of the files of the various motion
picture laboratories or not, but I would suggest that doing
that might answer some of our questions. Of course they are
dealing with motion picture film which is flammable, but it
may be, for all we know, that because of the fire hazards and
insurance rates, the motion picture firms of Hollywood may
have made experiments on making motion pictures on cellulose
acetate. It is thought it cannot be used for motion pictures <span style="page" id="page83">[p.83]</span> because of its physical qualities, for example its extreme
brittleness, but that is a possibility.

I would like to say this about the remarks of Mr.
Schwegmann. If he is going to be custodian of a lot of microfilm files he wants to know they are going to be some good.
Whenever microfilming is done on a WPA project we require
that the negative copy, and perhaps one positive print also,
be sent to the Library of Congress upon the termination of the
project. I believe I am right in saying that so far Mr.
Schwegmann hasn't been getting as much as he hoped, but we
are seeing to it that he is getting some and pretty soon he
is going to be receiving package after package in the mail of
rolls of film. Is it going to be eny good or not? I sympathize with the situation he would be faced with if we were
asking him to stock up a lot of stuff of inferior quality.

Also with regard to the type of machinery that he
wants to use, whether it be $1000 or $295, we are faced with
the problem of weight and portability. It is nice to have a
machine which you can place in Czechoslovakia and train a native
to use and go away and leave it in his hands, but if you want
something you can carry over a few mountains, and if the owner
of manuscripts won't bring them to the camera, it's nice to
have a Photorecord, or similar device; you can take apart and lug <span style="page" id="page84">[p.84]</span> to that particular retreat, and you can't do that very well
with one of the heavier machines such as the Eastman newspaper
camera.

I think Mr. Kellar has made some remarks that have
more than usual value in regard to the editing of our film.
You apply at some library for a copy of this or that manuscript
on film, it comes to you, and the only label is a little slip
of paper on the box that this is "Papers of so-and-so," or
the "Day book of such-and-such a person." You don't know
anything at all about the binding, because usually they don't
photograph the cover; you don't know whether it is of leather
or paper, you don't know whether the original paper is wood
pulp or rag; therefore, there is a very definite need for
some prefatory notes.

I might say in this connection that the Graphic
Service Corporation of Boston is publishing a number of
filmed books with complete critical textual introduction by
various American scholars. I know when I have ordered film
from the Library of Congress, I have had to make out an order
blank expressing exactly what pages I wanted films of, from
exactly what books, the library call number and other information which would more positively identify it, and sign it,
and when I get the film that order blank constitutes the
first frame of the film. <span style="page" id="page85">[p.85]</span>

I have ordered film from a microfilm service in
Philadelphia which made a neat typewritten title page and
photographed that at the beginning.

In the case of WPA newspaper indexing projects, we
require first of all that the index be brought to page form
and bound as a book and then after identifying the newspaper,
the index title which follows has to specify that the original
newspaper file for which this is an index has been microfilmed
on 35 mm. stock and the original deposited in the office of
the Library of Congress, Union Catalogue Section, Washington,
D. C., and perhaps the photofilm service from which copies
may be obtained at cost.

In the letters to the states which propose newspaper
indexing and microfilming work, I have also inserted this requirement, that a genuine contribution can be made to historical scholarship in America if for every newspaper indexed and
microfilmed, a preliminary statement be prepared which follows
the general pattern set by Clarence Brigham in his list of
American newspapers prior to 1820, with which you are probably
familiar. In that pattern Mr. Brigham set for himself, the
exact first date of publication is given, any editorial changes
are indicated, and so on.

The problem also comes up with microfilming newspapers  <span style="page" id="page86">[p.86]</span> as to where certain issues are available. While I am
speaking primarily of American newspapers, the same thing
would present itself if you wanted to photograph European
newspapers. Mr. Metcalf has spoken of the work they are doing
microfilming something like thirty-seven newspapers from various points in the world, and my understanding is that nothing
in the files goes back beyond June 30, 1938. We might consider the filming of the earlier files as the University of
Chicago did with the Draeger camera at the time of the Paris
Exposition, when they microfilmed all the newspapers back to
the French Revolution. I imagine they found certain pages
missing, or certain issues, and I very much doubt if they
have anything comparable to our *Union List of Newspapers* which
would point them to the sources where missing issues were available so they could be brought to the filming headquarters,
placed beside the regular file which is being microfilmed, and
every time you came to a gap which could be marked by a red
paper flag inserted in the paper, you could then remove that
file and substitute the auxiliary file which does contain the
missing issues, and then perhaps our prefatory notes would
indicate that the file as filmed was taken from the British
Museum with the exception of the issue for July 27 which was
obtained at such and such a location. <span style="page" id="page87">[p.87]</span>

We might also indicate there the present state of
the file, because some of them have to be microfilmed now
or never.

These are just a few points which probably would be
of interest to the persons using the film.

CO-CHAIRMAN LYDENBERG: Are we ready to go on with
No. 5 as to what apparatus, materials and processes have
proved to be most satisfactory, the question of improvements,
final limitations of speed, etc.?

MR. TATE: Mr. Chairman, before we leave No. 4 I
think probably it might be of some help to list a few specific
agencies, without discussing them, conducting research on the
technical problems. In the first place, it has been mentioned
that each individual installation in a library or archive or
similar institution conducts a certain amount of research.
In addition, the Committee on Scientific Aids to Learning has
been formed and has conducted certain researches into various
problems. Then the American Library Association Committee on
Photographic Reproduction of Library Materials has been active.
That is the parent body of the Journal of Documentary Reproduction which has served as a means of communication.
Mention should be made of the American Documentation
Institute and the Bibliofilm Service. Again, the National <span style="page" id="page88">[p.88]</span> Bureau of Standards is now working on a rather extensive
program in connection with the technical phases of activity
which are important, I think, in establishing our own
basic standards.

The various manufacturing concerns, such as the
Eastman Kodak Company, the Agfa Ansco Company, companies such
as that of Mr. Power, the Graphic Service Company in Boston,
the Folmer Graflex Corporation, the Recordak Corporation,
subsidiary of Eastman Kodak---those are merely a few of the agencies actually conducting technical work in this field, some
on the design of machines, some on the design and preparation
of sensitive material, others on the application. I think if
there is to be a list of facilities compiled, it might be
very usefully supplemented by a similar list of agencies conducting research work and agencies which might logically be
expected to have available the results of such research work
for more or less general distribution.

CO-CHAIRMAN LYDENBERG: Thank you. I am sure that is
admirably stated and I certainly hope it will be included
in the minutes of the conference.

MR. BEMIS: Mr. Chairman, in connection with this
next point to which you were proceeding, I would like to
suggest that that is a very technical subject and a great deal <span style="page" id="page89">[p.89]</span> of testimony might be brought out on that which would consume
a lot of time, and perhaps we might hasten matters by asking
Mr. Tate to give us within five or ten minutes a statement of
the major things that he could call to our attention. Otherwise, we will get lost in a maze of technicalities.

CO-CHAIRMAN LYDENBERG: Mr. Tate, we salute you!

MR. TATE: I can perhaps give you a few points. I
think in brief we can say that equipment exists which is suitable for the production of microfilm of any type, whether it
be in color or in monochrome, in large quantities or in small, of
bound volumes, of printed material, of manuscript, or of any
other type of original which we choose to film. I think that
statement will stand without going into further details.

With regard to improvements, there would seem to
be no profit in going into those. We are constantly improving
machinery of all types for the production, processing and
utilization of microfilms. We are exploring some films that
look at present to be promising; however, it may be research
that will lead us into a dead-end street. I think the improvements now in prospect are not such as would greatly influence
any program which we might adopt.

There have been final limitations on speed. I
shouldn't say "limitations." There is testimony on speed of <span style="page" id="page90">[p.90]</span> production. "Speed" is rather an ambiguous term. We know
pretty well that we can photograph certain types of originals
at certain rates of speed with certain types of equipment.

As to reduction ratio, that is elastic. We can reduce as high as seventy to eighty diameters if we see fit to
do so. Actually, we are not working much above thirty, if
that. The work that is being done is principally of the medium
to low reduction ratio classification.

Duplication is assured. We can duplicate the film
that we make if it is made córrectly.

Durability has been rather definitely ascertained
for us by the National Bureau of Standards. The phraseology
is doubtless familiar to you all. It is stated in terms of
permanence as relating to rag paper. Of course, one point
should be brought up there. Use and storage conditions will
determine durability of microfilm just as with books and any
other similar material.

All in all, I can merely repeat that we have the
apparatus, the sensitive material, enough technical knowledge
to produce microfilm which is usable and is being used.

Is that brief enough?

CO-CHAIRMAN LYDENBERG: Thank you, that is admirable
and complete. <span style="page" id="page91">[p.91]</span>

CO-CHAIRMAN LELAND: I wonder, Mr. Chairman, if there
are investigations under way which might change considerably
the nature of processes or at least change the character of the
product. For example, mention has been made of flat film;
mention has been made of microprints.

MR. TATE: If I might speak to that, Mr. Chairman, I
would state that flat filming, as has been stated already, is
a year or two away. We don't know yet whether there is anything
in it, or whether there is not. The chances are it will fill
certain applications, but one thing might be basic, and this
will hold for microprint as well. They are both essentially
edition processes and any microfilm made now in accordance
with the standards which we know can be adapted either to flat
film or to microprint within certain limitations.

CO-CHAIRMAN LELAND: I think the important thing to
consider is whether if any large-scale project should be undertaken now, the results would be inferior to what might be
secured if undertaken a year or two later, whether there are
any sensational or revolutionary changes or improvements likely
to be effected within a short time that would make it wise
to postpone any very large operations requiring the investment
of a considerable amount of money. That is something of course
that only the technicians can give us guidance about. <span style="page" id="page92">[p.92]</span>

CO-CHAIRMAN LYDENBERG: I gather so far as you know,
there is nothing radical.

MR. TATE: There are two or three things, and of
course we never know absolutely. I wouldn't like to say that
there is nothing that is not revolutionary in the immediate
offing. Yet it seems to me, I don't know, this is my personal
opinion only, that there is nothing close enough now that would
in any way interfere with anything which this group might choose
to do.

MR. SCHWEGMANN: Mr. Lydenberg, I would like to
express my opinion in regard to this question of what apparatus
materials and processes have proved to be satisfactory. The
new Recordak line of cameras I suppose are able to produce
nearly perfect microfilming; we needn't go into that except
to state if the proper film is used together with proper
technicians operating the camera, the lens in that camera is
capable of doing perhaps more than any lens ever used in a
microfilm camera.

The point I want to bring out is this: Those cameras
also are able to use 16 mm. film, which is rather a departure.
So far microfilming has been thought of in terms of 35 mm.
film, even for eight diameter reduction, simply because the
cameras used heretofore were not able to use anything else. A <span style="page" id="page93">[p.93]</span> great amount of book material can be reproduced on 16 mm.
film, the same identical quality of film as would be used
for 35, and especially if multiple copies, that is two or
three copies, are to be made, I think the economic feature of
16 mm. film should be considered in a oroposal such as we are
contemplating.

MR. BEMIS: If you say you can take a picture of a
document that size with 16 mm., would it enlarge ud sharply?

MR. SCHWEGMANN: Yes. You have very definite
limits; with the present equipment thirty is as high as the camera will take, but we pretty definitely know we can get perfect
enlargements from twenty diameters. It all depends on the
technician, and the size of the material itself, but for ordinary books printed in 10 or 12 point type, I am sure we can
go to 22 diameters reduction with perfect results, and I assume
that the bulk, or if not the bulk at least the large proportion
of the material we would contemplate copying, could successfully
be placed on 16 mm. film. The film cost would be somewhat less
for the negative and if several copies were made it would be
appreciably less.

One other factor must be considered. Since you
concentrate the image four to one, that is you get four times as
many images on 16 as on 35, the processing costs would be <span style="page" id="page94">[p.94]</span> materially less. In other words, you would process only one
roll as against four of the 35.

MR. VANDERBILT: I realize you are talking primarily
about microfilming equipment, but later on there is a good
deal about photographic apparatus. I wish Mr. Schwegmann would
report on card copying apparatus. In the kind of work I
have been connected with, one of the chief needs is efficient
card copying machinery which renders a full scale copy automatically. Is there any further development by Balsley of the
new transcription machine over the old film automatic enlarger?
What is the latest development on that?

MR. SCHWEGMANN: Nothing can be reported, although
there are many prospects just around the corner. I will
summarize the whole matter briefly. We became interested in
card copying at the Union Catalogue several years ago. We
developed a photographic enlarging process from 16 mm. film
which worked perfectly, but we had one drawback, that the
card itself would be on photostat or photographic paper and
you would have three elements that negate the usefulness of the
card: the emulsion, photographic paper, and worst of all, the
inability to typewrite or write, especially typewrite, on the
photographic image, that is the film on top of the paper. So
we dropped that phase of the investigation and got into what <span style="page" id="page95">[p.95]</span> I choose to call electrocopying technic. Mr. Balsley, to whom
Mr. Vanderbilt referred, had a diazo process which seemed to
have great promise, and after a year or so of writing back and
forth, he told me that the New York E.R.P.I. people were contemplating the development of his machine because it required
so many of the E.R.P.I. patents that they thought it could
best be handled that way. I went to New York and talked to
the E.R.P.I. people and the chief engineer assured me that this
is not an impossibility, in fact that the production of cards
on this diazo paper and by the electrocopying process, the
Ballsley idea, is absolutely feasible. There is no question in
his mind that the machine can be made to work and work beautifully. The only thing is the matter of money.

If I could assure him that enough machines could be
sold that they could retrieve from ten to fifteen thousand
dollars developing costs out of the profits from the sale of
these machines, they would proceed tomorrow. I have several
letters in my file to that effect. Unfortunately, I was
unable to sell the idea that such a machine would be in large
demand, especially when he asked me to name the price and I
said $300 each. Of course if we could name a price of $5,000
each and could be assured of a dozen sales, the whole thing
would be assured. <span style="page" id="page96">[p.96]</span>

So really, the only answer to your question, Paul,
is that if we could assure the E.R.P.I. people that we could
sell enough machines, or if someone could subsidize the
development cost, the thing could be gotten out very quickly.

MR. VANDERBILT: We are talking about a big project.
Is that a technical possibility to which we ought to pay a lot
of attention? Is the technical development done so he is ready
to go ahead? I think it is very important.

MR. TILLEUX: What is the speed of the diazo process
as compared to putting them through on a belt on a card copying device using 16 mm.?

MR. SCHWEGMANN: I think it is much faster because
the minimum speed would be four or five cards per minute and
the developing is absolutely like that (snapping fingers).

MR. VANDERBILT: I thought he had a self-feeder.

MR. SCHWEGMANN: Maybe so.

MR. THOMAS MARTIN: I wasn't here at the first part of
the meeting and I don't know whether the Draeger camera geared
to handle 70 mm. has been mentioned. Near the beginning of
this development of cameras, the Library of Congress had
Lieutenant Draeger construct a camera capable of using
70 mm. film. I understand that the mechanism is not perfected
so that the thing isn't usable just now, but it might be <span style="page" id="page97">[p.97]</span> possible to get an engineer to correct some of the faults in it
so that the 70 mm film could be used.

It is conceivable that this project might want to
use 70 film in copying large military charts and maps and
plans. They can be copied on 35 mm. film in sections and
the sections perhaps connected with each other, but on the
other hand, it might be desirable to copy on 70 mm. film,
especially where the material is very small and in great detail
and where the enlargement would be better from the 70 mm. film;
or it might be that the piece would be so large that it would
be desirable to get it all on one film for the sake of enlarging
it again on a very large piece of paper or enlarging it in
sections as one sees fit. So far as I know that is the only
camera in the country now available to anyone that uses the
70 mm. film.

MR. TILLEUX: Would that use cut film or rolled film?

MR. MARTIN: Rolled.

MR. TILLEUX: Wouldn't that have to be placed on
separate order? Wouldn't the film itself be relatively much
more expensive than the standard dimensions of 16 and 35?

MR. MARTIN: Perhaps Mr. Schwegmann can answer that
better than I can. I haven't been keeping up with the film
costs and that sort of thing. <span style="page" id="page98">[p.98]</span>

MR. TATE: No, it is available on government schedule
in several emulsions.

MR. HILL: On this matter of speed, I don't want to
speak about the technical development of that. Undoubtedly
the speed has been developed to an extent where I think a
warning on the other side might be made at this point. When
you are dealing with material, especially archival material,
in developing a project of this kind to a large extent you can
hardly expect to develop all this speed that the machinery will
be possible of because of certain limitations of labeling
your material and handling the material and turning it over.
It may be possible, as was indicated in some of the literature
that we received, that a book bound and loose enough so it can
be handled well, can be turned over at the rate of 500 sheets
or 1000 pages per hour, but I doubt if you can handle loose
manuscript material anything like that, so the speed of the
machine would be far beyond the possibility of the project
in handling the actual material.

MR. BEMIS: Mr. Chairman, I would like to put in a
word there. Speed isn't any factor at all, as Mr. Hill said.
We can get cameras that will take pictures fast enough, and as
fast as you can put the paper before them, but from a great
deal of experience in archives, along with Mr. Hill and other <span style="page" id="page99">[p.99]</span> people here, it is my opinion, all factors considered, that you
are lucky if you can take 200 photographs a day of manuscript
material. It is a very good record if you keep that up, and
you will frequently come down to 50.

MR. TATE: Mr. Chairman, I am afraid I will have to
rise to that one, because I have had some experience with manuscript material. As a matter of fact, I think I worked with
Mr. Bemis at one time. I don't know whether he knows it, but
I was also on Project "A". No, I think we can materially raise
that estimate now.

MR. BENIS: In the National Archives perhaps.

MR. TATE: No, I am thinking of copying in the
Mexican National Archives or foreign depositories.

MR. BEMIS: I say if you rise it to 10,000 it doesn't
make any difference.

MR. TATE: I will agree to that, but I don't like
that 200. I think that is too far down. I don't think any
estimate could be made on that basis, or should be made.

MR. KELLAR: May I ask that Hr. Fussler tell us about
the new RCA process.

MR. FUSSLER: I think there are several people in the
room who know more about the RCA process than I do. I met
it for the first time last week and I am not sure of its <span style="page" id="page100">[p.100]</span> relevance to this discussion. It is essentially a facsimile
method of producing 10 to 1 copies of, at present, single
sheets, although it may be adapted to book work later, by
an electrochemical method, not dissimilar from present systems
in facsimile transmission by radio and telephone companies.
I don't know whether we need to go into it much further than
that. The RCA people are very actively interested in it,
apparently. Experimental equipment has been constructed and
a good many of us here have seen samples that offer very great
promise. There are problems in the way of its full adoption
for library or scholarly reproductive problems but the system
is there, but again I would like to repeat I think there is
rather serious question whether it concerns us, at least for
the moment, for the general problem we are talking about today.

CO-CHAIRMAN LYDENBERG: Passing from the future to the
past, have any of us had the statisticians and arithmeticians
at us to work out the elements of cost and these other figures
that go into it? We have had the chemical people, the
mechanical people, and I don't see Stuart Rice here but I
am surprised that none of our statisticians have made a study
of this. I know of none. Do any of you?

MR. SEIDELL: May I be permitted to say a word on
the question of cost? The experience I have had in Bibliofilm <span style="page" id="page101">[p.101]</span> Service is that the keeping of records, the making out of
bills, the answering of letters, filling the orders in which
mistakes have been made, have cost a great deal more than all
the mechanical processes involved. I think in organizing all
of this work no one brought out that part of it at all so far.

There are two very distinct classes of work for microfilm. One is the production of material to serve as acquisitions for libraries, and of course as I understand it, that
is the principal subject for discussion. The other side of
the matter is supplying copies of material in libraries to the
individual workers. My interest has been only in that side
of the question so far, and for that purpose it is extremely
important that the question of cost be given very great
consideration. We assume that the individual worker for the
most part is more interested in producing something which will
be useful for society than he is in making a profit; most
of these individual workers, as a matter of fact, don't make
very much and it is of importance to supply them with material
at the lowest possible cost, and to do that, the mechanical
side of the operation is of a great deal less importance
than the organization of the production of the copies that
are to be distributed. So although that is of great interest
from my particular side of the question, I am not sure that <span style="page" id="page102">[p.102]</span> it really ought to be discussed by those of us who are interested solely in obtaining acquisitions for libraries. Perhaps
that side of it may not be of interest for discussion here.

CO-CHAIRMAN LYDENBERG: You can never get away from
the element of cost. You can't pay too much for whatever you
get; otherwise you become bankrupt.

CO-CHAIRMAN LELAND: Mr. Chairman, I think we are
interested in that other problem, too. We have discussed it
some already, that is the executing of short orders for individuals, and it is on the agenda a little later as to whether
emphasis should be given to these large projects for library
use or to orders for individual use, and the implication of
the agenda rather is that both of those activities are of
great deal of importance and must be considered.

MR. SEIDELL: If that is being considered, a great
deal of the discussion which is offered here on the perfection
of the work doesn't really apply. For a film that is to be
acquired by a library and to be used for making reproductions
for people who may desire it or for other libraries, it is
tremendously important that every possible care be used to
insure the perfection of that film, but for the individual who
receives a film for a temporary use, as in the case of men
engaged in scientific research, the man uses that as a part of <span style="page" id="page103">[p.103]</span> his own private collection of literature; he looks up a subject
and he gathers all of the references he can and makes copies
of them in one way or another; he obtains reprints when
possible, and if not, he obtains film copies and they are for
a temporary use. This man collects them for a while and when
he finishes his particular research, he publishes a paper and
then he throws the notes away.

It is very uneconomical to spend the time and effort
on perfecting such films as that, and to do so would increase
his cost unnecessarily. So I think we must also take into consideration the point of view that every microfilm that is made
does not necessarily have to be made perfectly. If it is made
well enough, carefully enough for this man to read and use
and learn what there is in the article, that will be sufficient

MR. BEMIS: Mr. Chairman, as to the element of cost,
I think a great deal of information can be had from the study
of the cost of Project "A" in the Library of Congress. I can
at this date recall only in a general way those costs, but
taking the first two years of the project in which several
hundred thousand facsimiles were made, I once made a calculation that those facsimiles cost about 24¢ apiece. I don't
mean enlarged. I have to say that subject to some confusion
because it included every facsimile: some of them were <span style="page" id="page104">[p.104]</span> photostats, some of them films, some of them were films that
were enlarged at the same time, but the mixture of results
in those first two experimental years, including the slow
production as the project got under way, boiled down to about
24¢ a photograph, and sometimes that photograph included an
enlargement, sometimes it was a photostat; sometimes it was
only a microfilm.

I am pretty sure that further study of costs would
show that as the project got into full production and continued
on a large scale in a dozen different countries, that cost
would have gone down nerhaps to 20¢. From what Dr. Sioussat
tells me, the work is still going on in England under that
project. I estimate that including the salaries paid and the
cost of a photographer, and so forth, it now costs on a small
scale, including I believe a little money on this side for
indexing and filing, about 50¢ a copy. If you go into this on
a big scale and use only microfilming, a really big scale,
say bigger than Project "A", I think you could get microfilming
costs down to five or six cents.

MR. SCHWEGMANN: I just happened to analyze the WPA
costs of filming newspapers in Cleveland. Their cost is 4¢
per page. The Library of Congress cost is approximately 2 1/2¢.
On large runs I think it comes down to about two. I think the <span style="page" id="page105">[p.105]</span> University of Chicago is perhaps even under that.

MR. BEMIS: That is newspaper. Manuscripts of course
are far more expensive.

MR. SCHWEGMANN: They are more difficult to handle.

CO-CHAIRMAN LYDENBERG: You say newspapers, and I
assume that means nothing but the straight run.

MR. SCHWEGMANN: Yes, so the price of 6¢ would
probably be cheap.

CO-CHAIRMAN LYDENBERG: It does bring into the case
the combining of the two files, when you need two to make one
perfect.

MR. VANDERBILT: I had a number of very interesting
conversations with Mr. Schwegmann a while ago on the relation
of photostat to microfilm, and I have often wondered what the
general consensus of opinion was. Is it safe to generalize,
following Mr. Davis' remarks a while ago, that photostat is
most applicable for reproducing manuscripts, but for the newspaper, for the whole book, for the whole archive, we should
use microfilming, and if we look into the future, probably the
most likely method for reduction of cost of full-scale copying
for the individual's use and for the small order would be the
photostat diazo processes, with lower costs for enlargement
than microfilm? Is that any consensus of opinion? Do you <span style="page" id="page106">[p.106]</span> still feel the same way, that the small microfilm order is
nuisance?

MR. SCHWEGMANN: It certainly costs more. At the
Library of Congress we feel that if five exposures need to be
made, it is cheaper to do it on photostat. After you leave
five, the price differential is very much in favor of microfilm.

MR. DANTON: Mr. Chairman, I am not speaking on these
two points but I would like to come back if I may to something
Mr. Seidell said and make two comments on the excellence of
microfilm. One is that at least my individual experience has
shown quite unmistakably so far as our own set-up is concerned
that there is very, very little difference in cost between
making a good film copy and a bad film copy. There is a
difference in the grand cost represented in the training of the
operator, but in actual operating costs and processing costs,
there is very, very little difference between the two.

The other comment, and one which seems to me rather
more important, at least from the point of view of those who
have the job of preserving films, keeping them and making
them available, is this: that a bad piece of filming may not
at the moment have any effect upon the person for whom the
film is in the first instance made but we never know when such
a film may come to a library. Indeed, most of us are very <span style="page" id="page107">[p.107]</span> glad to receive film copies that have been made even though
we may not have been the one that originally sought them out.
Therefore, if bad film is made, it is going to defeat its
own purpose in the end very often and there will simply be the
necessity of refilming.

I have in mind as a particular point an experience
we have had recently. One of the members of our faculty interested in American history from the period of approximately 1870
to 1895 has under two or three research grants been enabled
to go from north to south and east to west filming documents
connected with what he calls the rise of the farmer, and he
has been in a great many libraries filming diaries and bills
and manuscript records of all kinds, often I admit under very
adverse circumstances, but the material which he has gathered is
extremely important. Unfortunately, partially because of those
adverse circumstances, the film isn't worth very much, and although it is being turned over to our library, I prophesy it
will be of very, very little use to us and if anybody wants
that again five to ten years from now, it is going to have
to be redone, and that is certainly a great waste of thousands
of dollars of time and money.

MR. TILLEUX: Mr. Chairman, I think possibly the
best criterion is what commercial firms are actually able <span style="page" id="page108">[p.108]</span> to turn out microfilm at, and if I am not mistaken, the
University Microfilms has a standard rate of 3 1/2¢ per
image, but I can order them from certain libraries in Germany
for 10 pfennig for five exposures and 5 pfenning for each
additional exposure, or for 75 centimes in France.
If they can do that, that it seems to me sets a limit since they
already have to stand overhead, employees' wages and so forth.
There is of course a minimum charge; that is, if I wanted
just a page of something I would have to pay $2.50 to get it
but if I wanted 500 pages or 10,000 pages, I would come under
that rate of 75 centimes. Perhaps Mr. Power could speak to us
more authoritatively on that from the commercial angle of it.

MR. HILL: Is that the price for printed books?

MR. TILLEUX: I believe it is---periodicals and
printed books.

MR. BEMIS: I would like to make this point. That
is just the cost of photography and film but we have to add
to that, and I was including in the calculations I made,
the overhead of scholars, vigilators,
and so forth.

MR. TILLEUX: When I spoke a few moments ago about
the high speed camera, what I had in mind was the high speed
reproduction of the card catalogues in various European archival
institutions. They may have two and a half million cards there. <span style="page" id="page109">[p.109]</span> What we want to know is what is on those cards. We want to know
it quickly and we want to know it on 16 mm. film. We want to
take the tray of cards, dump it in the machine and have
them go through clippety-clip and there we have the reproductions. They are very cheap but once we have them and we
can assemble them in the form of a comprehensive catalogue,
then we know where certain materials are available, and then
we know whether it is of any purpose for the scholar to go
abroad to find out certain things. We can send an order through
A.D.I. or University Microfilms for such and such a book in
Berlin or in Bonn or Essen, or wherever we wish to go, and from
the card catalogue we know exactly the shelf number where the
book is to be found, and if we wish, we can send the microprint
of that particular frame and get it.

CO-CHAIRMAN LYDENBERG: Mr. Power, have you anything
to tell us about your experience, practical and theoretical?

MR. POWER: It is true, as you just said, that if
you know the exact reference and if you know exactly where the
book is, or just where it is located, and the call number,
you do reduce the cost, there is no question about that. And
that cost, naturally, is below the 3 1/2¢ rate or I wouldn't
be able to charge it. In any large-scale project such as
might be considered here it is necessary either to pay some <span style="page" id="page110">[p.110]</span> member of the library staff to get those books out of the stacks
and look them up and locate them and bring them to the camera,
or the library has to charge you for it. Obviously, I can't
impose that burden on the library; I don't, because I arrange
to pay the library for that sort of service. If we have
any large-scale project and we have adequate equipment, good
equipment, we can be assured that the cost will be rather low,
because as has been brought out, the actual cost of copying
isn't very much; when you take the cost of a man and the cost
of a camera spread over three or five years, and the cost of
film and the cost of processing divided by the number of pages
that he will produce in a day, you have a very low figure. I
don't think anybody yet has hit a figure that is as low as
can be secured or can be attained if the work is properly
organized and properly collected.

CO-CHAIRMAN LYDENBERG: If conditions are ideal.

MR. POWER: In a large-scale project they can be ideal.

MR. HILL: I wou'd like to ask Mr. Danton with
respect to the objection to this film, is it because it is
not adequately labeled, and that sort of difficulty, or is it
the mechanical difficulty of bad exposure that you were talking
about? <span style="page" id="page111">[p.111]</span>

MR. DANTON: I would suppose the mechanical difficulty
of bad exposure, and I understand some of it had to be done in
barns by candlelight. The gentleman in question isn't to
blame but the conditions are bad, and perhaps under an ideal
set-up we wouldn't have that situation. Already two other
men in the history department have been anxious, for example,
to get prints of certain sections for certain years of this
material, and it is almost impossible to make satisfactory
prints for them.

MR. THOMAS MARTIN: Any manuscripts photographed in a
barn or haymow with candlelight are in imminent danger of destruction. I should think we would be very grateful for any
copy of it, and if that copy is poor, it ought to be reproduced
immediately on good film which will be preserved.

I think from what we hear from abroad all the time
and what we are continually experiencing in this country with
respect to the destruction of manuscripts, that we ought in
all of these operations to keep in mind the fact that the copy
may sometime become the unique copy in place of the manuscript
itself.

MR. WATSON DAVIS: Mr. Chairman, I would like to
suggest that serious consideration be given to the use of
35 mm. film on account of the uniformity and the international <span style="page" id="page112">[p.112]</span> interchange of film. As a matter of fact, in answer to the
suggestion that we go into 16 mm. film, I think on two grounds
a plea can be made that it shall not be used. One is that
area for area it is a more expensive form of sensitized surface
because of the fact that you are looking at low reduction
ratios and you can use ordinary positive 35 mm. film and the
price is set in Hollywood, whereas the price of 16 mm. is not
set in Hollywood and is higher per unit of area.

The other thing I would like to mention is this: For
ease of operation I think it is highly desirable to use microfilm even for one, two, three, four, five frames, and in some
cases it would be economical to give the single or a few frames
of film in the form of photoprints, if that is desired by the
user; it is cheaper to have enlargements made rather than to
duplicate your microfilming apparatus with the photostat
machine. In fact, one of the things we ran into earlier in
the development of the microfilm apparatus was the very interest
ing observation I found in an early trip to Europe, that the
Prussian State Library was making use of the enlargements from
microfilm in preference to photostats, not because they had any
fondness or love for film for such, but because it was distinctly a cheaper process than the photostat process.

MR. TILLEUX: Mr. Chairman, as Mr. Davis already knows <span style="page" id="page113">[p.113]</span> full well and could have told you, the question isn't as
simple as deciding to use 35 mm. film. There immediately enter
other angles: Are we going to use lavender 35 mm.? Are we
going to use double perforate, single perforate or imperforate
35 mm. film? Some of the companies, particularly those which
are microfilming newspapers, want to have as much photographical
area available as possible and they say the part at the edge
where sprocket holes are punched is just waste, and therefore
you should use imperforate film and carry your image to the
edge and you will have a larger image which will yield better
reproduction, but if you send that to Germany they will tear
their hair out because their cameras are geared to take perforated film, and if we are going to deal with European repositories I think we have got to follow their standards largely.
My understanding is that they want double perforate film.

CO-CHAIRMAN LYDENBERG: Are we prepared to go on to
No. 7 to find out what special training of operating and supervisory personnel is necessary and what facilities exist for
such training, to get rid of the method of trial and error that
has governed most of us and pass on to the next generation the
benefit of our experience?

MR. POWER: I am sorry to revert back to the question
before that, but as regards the matter of cost, in the reply <span style="page" id="page114">[p.114]</span> to the preliminary memorandum, under suggestions, I quoted
from a letter of mine regarding the photographing of the
Public Record Office index, some 15,000 volumes. That might
be a typical case in point and give some idea of cost. That
does not include the cost of looking up books or bringing them
to the camera.

In this case the index is on one shelf and you
can take it from one to the other. You should be able to
photograph approximately 2,000,000 pages for approximately
$7,000, including the cost of equipment and an operator, and
that gives some idea of what can be done so far as cost goes,
providing the work is sufficiently organized and carried out
with the proper sort of equipment.

CO-CHAIRMAN LYDENBERG: You say it can be done for
$7,000 including the cost of equipment and an operator?

MR. POWER: That includes processing, salary to the
operator, transportation to the United States, and a certain
amount for inspection.

CO-CHAIRMAN LYDENBERG: And a reasonable profit.

MR. POWER: No, that is only cost.

MR. BEMIS: He is talking about books. Manuscripts
are entirely different.

MR. TATE: Mr. Chairman, I would like to add one
point. Would it be advisable to refer to the Continuation <span style="page" id="page115">[p.115]</span> Committee the recommendation that a very careful survey of
exactly what constitutes cost of microfilm, based on the various
points that have been brought uŋ in this discussion, be made?
In other words, we haven't really discussed cost and its elements. We have talked around the subject a good deal, but no
one has analyzed cost in terms of materials, labor, camera
time; no one has expressed the intangible costs that do come
in now. I don't think there would be any profit in doing so
now.

CO-CHAIRMAN LYDENBERG: No, we don't know enough about
it.

MR. TATE: I do think it should be referred to the
Continuation Committee.

CO-CHAIRMAN LYDENBERG: In this democratic town-meeting fashion, I will declare the motion made, seconded and
carried.

Now may we go on to the question of training? Where
can a man learn about this? Who is passing on to the next
generation the experience that we have developed? How is
that tradition to be passed on?

MR. DOWNS: There are courses set up in two universities, Columbia and Chicago, for teaching microphotography.

CO-CHAIRMAN LYDENBERG: Are they both in connection <span style="page" id="page116">[p.116]</span> with library school work?

MR. DOWNS: That is right.

CO-CHAIRMAN LYDENBERG: How do they differ? Does
Chicago try to put it in the realm of graduate work?

MR. DOWNS: Mr. Fussler teaches one of the courses.
He might tell us.

CO-CHAIRMAN LYDENBERG: Is there any essential difference, Mr. Fussler, do you know, between the two as to ideals
or details?

MR. FUSSLER: I can only speak on the basis of second-hand information with regard to the course at Columbia University. So far as that second-hand information goes, I think
there is a difference in the approach to the problem at the
two schools. The Columbia course is given in the first year,
or can be given to a first-year student at Columbia Library
School, and as I understand it, they are more concerned at
present with a study of elementary equipment and elementary procedure, both in the production and application of microfilm
problems in libraries.

At Chicago we are dealing with students who are
graduate students, that is they have completed a first year
of graduate study in library schools and for that reason
presumably will become administrators or go into administrative <span style="page" id="page117">[p.117]</span> positions in libraries and will not, it is presumed, be
operating photographic equipment themselves. For that reason,
our approach has been from the administrative aspect of the
problems involved and we do not attempt to give any basic
laboratory instruction which is given at Columbia. The students, however, are sent at several intervals throughout the
course to study operations and procedures in a working laboratory, but they, themselves, thus far have not done any of that
type of work.

MR. TILLEUX: Mr. Fussler, is it not merely to
visit the projects and sit and watch the men at work, and
then return to their classroom? I don't believe they are given
the laboratory training.

MR. FUSSLER: Yes, they are not given laboratory
training. I would not say it is limited to that because I
am running the laboratory and teaching the course at the same
time, so we are able to go into it from a considerably more
detailed viewpoint than observation. That is, the situation
which the students will see in that particular laboratory is
known to them before they see it and is then discussed afterwards, but it certainly is not an attempt to turn out students
who would be operators of pieces of equipment when they finish
the course, though the assumption is made if they should desire <span style="page" id="page118">[p.118]</span> to go into it, they could without very much additional expenditure of time become operators.

MR. VANDERBILT: There might be some parallel in the
kinds of instruction which are given in other kinds of photography. I am under the impression the best photographic course
is in the Signal Corps where they are engaged in training
photographers for aerial work. I know photographers who consider the Signal Corps Manual the best textbook there is. Is
there anything microphotography can gain from them?

MR. TATE: Mr. Chairman, there are really three
problems in training personnel. The first one is the training
of the personnel to do the actual photography and laboratory
work and that personnel is of two grades: first, the low-cost,
routine camera operator. Their training requires meeting
some particular problems. They are taught to do a certain
number of things in certain sequence. Second, in the supervisory, or you might say chief technician's rank, training which
requires that a man know not only microphotography but
know photography and have as much advanced training in physics
and chemistry as he can possibly get. Those men are almost impossible to find, and I speak from sad experience. Usually you
have to pick up either a chemist or physicist, or in some
cases someone who isn't a photographer, and give him specialized <span style="page" id="page119">[p.119]</span> training and urge him to develop himself into a man capable of
handling a job of that type.

Then there are the men who set out the work, those
who have charge of the laboratory.

There are really about four levels of training that
have to be considered in any discussion of training, and I
know of no place outside of the two courses, and outside of the
various operating laboratories, where a personnel can be recruited. I have been told that it is sometimes even rather
difficult to get a good laboratory man without swiping him
from someone else, and I have been looking around to do a little
swiping, incidentally, without any luck.

MR. BEMIS: Mr. Chairman, I might ask Mr. Tate this:
I understood somebody to say that you are preparing a manual.

MR. TATE: Yes, sir.

MR. BEMIS: The fact that you are preparing a manual
and that you are doing this work in the National Archives
suggests that it might be expedient and practical to admit as
interns, to use a word we often employ now, a sufficient number
of persons to get training for this type of work in case
project were devised.

MR. TATE: That has been considered. The manual
itself is not intended for precisely this sort of thing. It is <span style="page" id="page120">[p.120]</span> intended to acquaint the individual scholar or scientist with
microphotography and its uses, and to acquaint him with the
operation of the simpler types of equipment, the simpler proces
ing procedures, utilization of filing media, and so on, so that
he can use microphotography in his own work.

As to the interns, we could perhaps take some interns
in the National Archives but it would make rather heavy inroads
on my own time---if you will excuse me for speaking selfishly---in trying to train those men to handle the type of work they
would come up against in a oroject of this type.

MR. BEMIS: But that is just the type of training
they ought to get.

MR. TATE: It could be done. Perhaps it may be
possible. I would suggest also that such interns be placed
in units doing more work than we, such as the Library of
Congress, or the University of Chicago, or Columbia or some of
the others, if that were desirable. In other words, there is
no place now where we can recruit the technical personnel of a
chief operator's grade. Men just have to be taken and trained,
and there is no place they can go outside of one of these
operating units to be trained, and we haven't got time to train
them.

MR. BEMIS: In Germany they have such schools. <span style="page" id="page121">[p.121]</span>

MR. TATE: I understand they do.

MR. TILLEUX: Mr. Chairman, someone this afternoon
mentioned that in one foreign country where they attempted to
make a study of technical considerations, that had to be
tabled because the persons delegated to make the study were unwilling to put on aprons and go into the laboratory, they
considered it beneath them. We don't have that here and I
think the University of Chicago under Mr. Raney and Mr. Fussler,
and Columbia which has a school, not only should give general
orientation courses in the form of lectures, but also offer
laboratory work which would carry four or eight semester hours.
The reason that I think that is possibly a selfish one from the
WPA point of view, but we frequently get applications for
microfilming projects which we turn down because of the unacceptability of the person proposed to supervise it. On one
occasion we had a Ph.D. graduate of one of our largest universities who was very, very angry at us because we did not
accept his qualifications as the actual supervisor of the
microfilming. He argued that he had seen the material, the
processes, in operation, had handled the materials and felt
perfectly qualified. We don't like to get into arguments of
that kind. What we have to do, therefore, whenever microfilming
is proposed under a WPA project, is to require that a full <span style="page" id="page122">[p.122]</span> statement of the work, the schedule of all the operations, the
footage of film which would be required, the number of pages
or units to be filmed, be sent to our procurement office
and opened for bids, and then University Microfilms or Holbrook
or Graphic Service Corporation, or Eastman, for example, or
any of the other companies, can enter bids and they are supposed
to take over complete preparation of that microfilm, including
the laboratory processing, the preparation of the positive
prints. That guarantees us that we will get acceptable quality
material, but that still doesn't solve the big problem of
training new people to carry on the work.

MR. THOMAS MARTIN: Mr. Chairman, it strikes me that
we have to consider the preservation of material being photographed as well as the actual processed photograph. I once saw
some volumes from the State Department going under a microfilm
camera in such fashion that I am quite sure the manuscripts
were permanently damaged and the collection made less valuable.
It seems to me that in this special training of supervisory
personnel, that a little schooling in library care of books
and in what we might call the diplomatics in the start of
training, such as the first-year graduate student gets in a
course in medieval, or the labeling of medieval manuscripts,
where care has to be used, certainly ought to be taken into <span style="page" id="page123">[p.123]</span> consideration. If we are going to turn loose a blitzkrieg
on historical material, that is manuscript material particularly,
we ought to look particularly and especially to getting people
trained in handling historical material.

There are certain people who come into the Manuscript
Division that we know from an initial glance at them it won't
do to let the manuscripts pass through their fingers; we had
better use photostat copies and let them take the risk. Such
people ought not to be let in the operating or supervising
personnel.

MR. TATE: There has come up two or three times the
question of two or three men who came from Europe to study
microphotography and didn't wish to get their hands dirty.
Without going into the details of the matter, I would like to
say that that impression, I think, is quite erroneous. I knew
those men who came over, I saw them in the laboratory with
aprons on and with their hands dirty. Perhaps not in justification but in explanation, I might say that they learned
certain things and they believed from the general purpose of
their visit that there were other things that were of more
immediate importance than working in the laboratory, and that
in particular was the reason why they did not spend all of
their time in that particular course. <span style="page" id="page124">[p.124]</span>

MR. HILL: Mr. Chairman, we have been talking here
I think more directly to the matter of personnel in this country
and training personnel in this country. It ought to go in
the record here again, I think, that a good deal of the mechanical force that would go into this large project abroad will be
native people. It would seem to me, then, you will be in
the position of having to teach the supervisor all
these technics so he can see that the other people can carry
on, because it will be the training of the individual on the
specific job very largely that will be important if you
went to apply the standards set up here.

CO-CHAIRMAN LYDENBERG: Mr. Co-Chairman, may I ask
if you think the time is approaching when we ought to prepare
for the ordeal of leaving?

CO-CHAIRMAN LELAND: I think the time has come, Mr.
Chairman, when we could recess for a short time, to meet again
for dinner at the Cosmos Club. Perhaps we might dispense
with the reading of the minutes for this session and give
the Reporter a chance to compose them, and if he wishes to
present them at the opening of the evening session he can do
so, of course. We will begin this evening with Section III,
the consideration of the general problem in the light of
present circumstances, in which we have got to discuss problems <span style="page" id="page125">[p.125]</span> of general policy, and perhaps we can get into Section IV,
the discussion of methods of selection, although that is going
to be a difficult section to discuss and we may have to put
that over until tomorrow.

... The meeting adjourned at five-thirty o'clock ...

<span style="page" id="page126">[p.126]</span>

WEDNESDAY EVENING SESSION

June 5, 1940

The meeting was called to order at eight o'clock by
Dr. Waldo G. Leland, Co-Chairman of the Conference.

CO-CHAIRMAN LELAND: We come now to Section III,
which is entitled, "Consideration of General Problem in Light of
Present Circumstances," and we have two general questions.
The first is, "Is it desirable to organize large-scale projects:

"(a) In foreign countries, and if so, which, Europe
Asia, Latin America, Africa, Oceania.

"(b) In the United States and British America?" In
other words, domestic projects.

I think we can only have expressions of opinion with
regard to these.

If anybody has decided opinions about this, either
yea or no, that in spite of circumstances we can go ahead
and organize large-scale projects, or that in view of the
circumstances we ought not to try to, or that in view of the
circumstances we ought to try to organize them in certain parts
of the world and not try to organize them in others, let us
have those opinions. The collective wisdom of this group with
regard to that will be very helpful to the Continuation
Committee, I am sure. And so I should like first to have <span style="page" id="page127">[p.127]</span> remarks to that question: Is it desirable to organize large-scale projects, and if so, where?

MR. LUNT: Mr. Chairman, in view of your opening
remarks and some of the letters which were distributed to us,
it seems to me that at the present time it would be unwise to
plan immediately to begin such operations in Europe, and that
is the only possible world of which I can speak, and of course
I can speak for only a small portion of that. But it does
seem to me that now would be the time to begin laying plans
for large-scale operations to take place whenever the war may
be finished, and there are two possible ways of going about it,
and the method pursued would be very different. I could think
much more clearly if I had some notion of which of the two ways
was desirable.

Are we, when this war is finished, to begin to plan
to save documents from destruction in the next war that comes,
or would it be wise simply to plan to microfilm documents which
are needed for projects of research already under way or for
projects projected within a limited number of years?

My own opinion would be that the latter course would
be desirable. If one tries to start the process of saving
documents from destruction, the number of documents is so overwhelming that it seems to me an impossibility unless you have <span style="page" id="page128">[p.128]</span> limitless amounts of money. If one thinks of attempting to
make microfilms of all the manuscripts in the Public Record
Office, in the Vatican archives, for example, and realize that
he has only made the first faint beginning of photostating
all the manuscripts, that sort of thing seems to me at the
moment out of the question.

But the second procedure would be very desirable and
would greatly facilitate research in this country.

CO-CHAIRMAN LELAND: You have heard Mr. Lunt's
observations on that in which he draws a distinction between
photographing for the principal purpose of preservation and
microfilming for purposes of immediate or future estimated
needs. Are there any other observations on this point?

MR. LONG: Mr. Chairman, precisely for the reasons
that the gentleman has urged I advocate we undertake at least
one large-scale project now for the purpose of experimentation
looking toward the later large-scale operations.

CO-CHAIRMAN LELAND: Are you thinking of copying
everything in a certain category of materials or certain
depository, or are you thinking of copying everything relating
to a possible project of research?

MR. LONG: I am thinking of it primarily as a method
of training and preparation for a major later action. <span style="page" id="page129">[p.129]</span>

MR. POWER: I was going to suggest, as I did in the
reply that I wrote to you, that assuming---and this is merely
an assumption---that Italy does not come into the war, and that
may not be a very good assumption, it would be a good place to
start. I think in that reply I outlined some costs of
what it would take as a preliminary or as a sample project which
would demonstrate whether or not the method would be feasible
in other countries after the war to take certain manuscripts
in Italy.
Particularly in view of the fact that a good part
of the work of photographing manuscripts has already been done
by the Institut d'Histoire des Textes, I believe an arrangement
could be made to exchange with them those manuscripts that they
have already filmed. The estimated cost of the whole job is
about $26,000.

MR. VANDERBILT: This may not be the time to undertake large-scale operations in the collection of materials
themselves, but it seems to me imminently the time to do
large-scale bibliographical operations, to do the survey of
desiderata which can be done in this country, which would be
an exceedingly valuable thing to do if no filming were done
for the present at all. Regardless of the war situation, it
seems to me an admirable time to begin acquiring bibliographies <span style="page" id="page130">[p.130]</span> and particularly filming library catalogues which exist in
manuscript form only.
Those propositions which appeal to me most among the
preliminary statements were proposal to film such things as
the subject index of the Public Record Office in London. I am
thinking particularly of an exhaustive and complete program of
bibliographical development which is a necessary initial step
to allowing a sound formulation of work for any future filming
that may be done. Of course, in any case, a plan to get into
the United States all material that is necessary to scholars 18
going to take years and years and years.

CO-CHAIRMAN LELAND: That in itself would be
large-scale project, wouldn't it; I mean the photographing
of all possible catalogues, or all useful catalogues. And
at the same time it would lay the foundation for other projects
that might be developed afterwards on the basis of the information that would be available by the possession of those
catalogues.

MR. LUNT: Mr. Chairman, this subject index of the
Record Office is something that I heard of first in the preliminary statement. I have worked in the Record Office off and on
all my life. There is a similar subject index in the Vatican
archives, the well-known Garanti index. I question the <span style="page" id="page131">[p.131]</span> value of getting an index to manuscripts---inventories and catalogues, well and good, but indexes---why get indexes, when
after all, you would still have to go through the manuscript
itself to make sure that nothing has been omitted.

MR. BUCK: Mr. Chairman, it occurs to me that the
suggestion that has just been made about microfilming what
we might call lists or finding mediums ties in with the
remark that Mr. Bemis made this afternoon about the fundamental
part that the Carnegie guides played in connection with
project "A". It is quite true that the project could not have
been anywhere near as successful as it was except for the
compilation of those guides in advance, but that was a project
for the selection of material on a restricted subject, and
consequently selective guides to that material were necessary.
We are concerned, as I take it, with a project for
the selection of material of research important in all fields,
and the guides for such a selection actually exist in many
cases in these inventories and catalogues, many of which are
available only in manuscript. You asked for opinions. I am,
therefore, strongly of the opinion that the first and fundamental step for any project of this sort is the obtaining and
making available for further study in connection with possible
future projects, and also in connection with research activities <span style="page" id="page132">[p.132]</span> under way, of the various guides, inventories and catalogues
that may be available. I am inclined to agree with Mr. Lunt,
however, that the so-called subject catalogues and subject
indexes would probably be of much less value than the lists.
The Public Record Office has a very large collection of what
they call lists and indexes. Most of their indexes are really
lists, however, to a large extent, perhaps index lists---some forty or fifty of them have been printed and are available
but there are literally hundreds of manuscript lists in the
Archives Nationale and in most other archive establishments,
and then there are the great cataloguing projects that could
be obtained.

It seems to me such a project would have the further
advantage that it would give experience in technics and ways
of organizing projects and carrying them through that could be
applied later when perhaps conditions would make it more
feasible to carry on extensive library projects of the reproduction of books, maps, manuscripts and things of that sort.

MR. NICHOLS: Mr. Leland, in the absence of Mr. Bemis
I would like to say a word or two in support of his idea of
using South America as an experimental ground for developing
technics and making preparations for the peace assault upon
Europe. I doubt whether we can get very far in Europe at this <span style="page" id="page133">[p.133]</span> time, even in Italy, and it would seem in spite of the
difficulties which are enormous, we might be working along the
lines of developing our interest in Latin American cooperation
through means of this sort.

MR. THOMAS MARTIN: I think we might look forward
to something that happened in Napoleon's time. Perhaps the
same sort of thing happened earlier than that. When Napoleon
conquered some of these countries of Europe, he raided the
archives, or rather, his officials raided the archives and
brought large quantities of the materials to Paris. We know
that when the Germans went into Poland, they were very keen
to get at the current diplomatic correspondence of Poland, and
I believe they published some sort of a book, whether white,
green or yellow, on documents they found in the Polish archives.
These countries that are being overrun are doubtless removing
archives they don't want Hitler to get at and carrying them
off to various places.
During the last world war, a large part of the
British archives were moved out to Cambridge. It may be they
will have to move them a great deal farther than Cambridge,
perhaps over to Canada. We might even have some of these
refugee archives, which of course are editorial selections
by the officers in power, sent over to this country for safe <span style="page" id="page134">[p.134]</span> keeping until after the war, so it is just possible we might
foresee the necessity of organizing a project for copying
refugee collections which are fleeing from Great Britain and
France and Italy and Poland and other places, over to this
country, or over to the Far East, anywhere where they can get
out of range of war. And these editorial selections by the
officials themselves, such as Hitler's officials would make
if they had a chance, or as the French and British and other
officials are making, in order to get the documents out of his
way---those things are certain to be of very great interest to
historians in the future, so I think it might be well just to
keep in mind the fact that these editorial selections made officially at the present time might come our way and we might
profit greatly by making copies of them.

CO-CHAIRMAN LELAND: Mr. Bemis, in your absence, Mr.
Nichols suggested the possibility of devoting attention very
largely to copying in South America, and referred to the
memorandum which you prepared and which was distributed to
this conference on its arrival. I think perhaps if we could
hear from you and from Mr. Hill and from Mr. Leonard and from
one or two others who are familiar with South American conditions here, or Latin American conditions, and Mr. Scholes, it
might be useful to discuss that. Do you want to add anything

## p. 135 (#281) ############################################

to your memorandum?

MR. BEMIS: No, I don't think I need to repeat that.
The parts that occurred to me in that memorandum, which some of
you may have glanced at, are that in view of the disturbed
condition of Europe and the sympathetic attitude at present
existing in Latin America, it is a distinctly practical thought
to consider stepping from Europe to Latin America into photocopying work. The one handicap which we have is that we do
not have the guides available for Latin American material
relating to American history in Latin American archives. I am
speaking only of the subject of American history. We do not
have the guide for that which we had when the work began in
Europe. Nevertheless, I think it is possible to begin work on
certain specifically designated forms of documents there.

The little survey which I made myself in certain of
those countries incidental to other duties indicates to me that
there is material enough to begin a modest program, relatively
inexpensive, and extremely fruitful for future research work
on the line of Project "A."

I suggest that the Library of Congress ought to be
the one to undertake that as an expansion of project "A" or
as a modification of Project "A" at this particular time. I
think that if an experienced person could be sent down there to <span style="page" id="page136">[p.136]</span> set the work in motion, that it could be organized so
carry on of itself, the way, for example, the work is now
carrying on in England and was carrying on in France, that it
is a project which could be wound up in a relatively short time
that is in a year or two years, and that is eminently practical,
economical, and useful. The other details I have set forth in
that memorandum indicate some specific documents that exist
there which would be useful here and which could be copied,
but I think the biggest field for work is in Rio de Janiero.

CO-CHAIRMAN LELAND: Let's hear from some other
experts on South America. Dr. Hill?

DR. HILL: First, I would like to speak to the
general question. It seems to me that there is not the time,
perhaps, actually to undertake a complete major project,
but certainly it is a time to look ahead toward that major
project. Of course, the wholesale reproduction of some European archives, even for protection, doesn't appeal to me
because if you began figuring how long it would take to reproduce the archives of the Indies and Seville, the next war, if
there is going to be one, would be upon us long ere the project
has finished. So I am for the line Mr. Lunt has suggested of
working along the line of projects, either under way, or
that are somewhat in the immediate future. <span style="page" id="page137">[p.137]</span>

Then that brings us to the Latin American angle. I
quite agree with Mr. Bemis that it is a field that ought to be
worked and could be worked, and on the other side, I think
there are a good many in those countries that are interested
in it and might be interested in getting something from here
that would illustrate their story from this angle, so that a
project might be worked out which would be mutually helpful
and would facilitate developing the work and making the matter
so that it was really a workable project.

I don't know that it could be done in quite as short
a time; I am rather inclined to disagree with Mr. Bemis about
the length of time. I think it may be longer than that, but
I think it is a very nice project and one that is practicable
and one that ought to be put foremost in the schedule of the
Continuation Committee.

CO-CHAIRMAN LELAND: Mr. Scholes, you have much
experience in organizing copy in Mexico.

MR. SCHOLES: I know nothing about South American
archives, however. In the case of Mexico and Guatemala the
one thing that bothers me would be the matter of what to get.
In the Mexican archives there is an enormous collection. On
the other hand, any basic body of materials that you would
want, at least for the colonial period, for Mexico should come <span style="page" id="page138">[p.138]</span> from Seville and not from Mexico itself. There are certain
parts of the Mexican archives that could be reproduced very
quickly, certain fundamental series, but the bulk of that
archive certainly is not of the character that you would want
to use for any large-scale reproduction unless you have the
Seville background first.

You would want to supplement from Mexico what you
would get out of Seville.
There are parts of the Mexican
archives that could be reproduced very quickly and would be
very useful, but the major sections of that archive are essentially supplementary materials that really wouldn't be of the
greatest value unless you had, let us say, the correspondence
series from Seville, because in Mexico you do not have the
correspondence series, at least until about 1760. You have the
Cedulas series beginning about 1620. You have 1500 volumes of
the Inquisition archive, but I can't conceive of anyone wanting
to copy that as a block.
What I would much rather see this conference do would
be to develop some sort of clearing agency in this country for
the materials that we already have, some information service
with regard to materials out of Seville, out of Mexico, or any
other discipline---I am speaking now only for history---partly to
avoid duplication if you do embark upon any large-scale program, <span style="page" id="page139">[p.139]</span> and second to make known to us what is already here in this
country. In the case of South America, I think there are
certain groups of papers, such as Dr. Bemis has suggested, that
could be reproduced in a comparatively short time, although
some of the major archives, such as the Peruvian archives, are
in such chaos, apparently, that it would be pretty difficult
to operate.

CO-CHAIRMAN LELAND: Is that because the archivist
is the dean of the University?

MR. SCHOLES: Who knows?

MR. NICHOLS: Obviously!

MR. SCHOLES: More than that, you are trying to
decide whether you are going to anticipate needs or operate
on the basis of particular projects, which are two sub-headings
under this section. It seems to me that there the fundamental
question is to operate on the basis of taking large blocks
of materials, as any great selective process is going to run
into such great overhead costs that it is not going to be an
economical procedure. Whether you try to anticipate needs or
try to take materials that scholars in this country want,
they should be taken in large blocks, in large groups, and not
with any extensive selective process within certain categories
of materials themselves. <span style="page" id="page140">[p.140]</span>

MR. SIOUSSAT: Mr. Chairman, may I add to what you
started to say in the first section? When we were talking about
1, 2, and 3, I made the point this afternoon that some
things came up there which would seem to come up later in 2,
3, and 4, on the basis of the experience that we have, and
both what Dr. Bemis has said and what has just been said bear
that out, now that we have come along later in the procedure
to the question of looking to the future.
It is my almost weekly regret that so much of the
intensely valuable work that has been done in the Spanish
archives alone has been on a selective basis, on so casual and
intermittently a selective basis, because I am quite certain
that within the Library of Congress, to say nothing of the
Ayer collection and the Durrett collection and other
groups of transcripts and copies, there is much duplication
and much that is omitted, even down to the present time. We
don't have to go to South America, we don't have to go to
Europe, we can stay right in Spain and in the Spanish archives,
and the transcripts and microfilms that we have over here,
and find something exceedingly exasperating and difficult to
administer.

One of the things I remember very well, when my
beloved and honored predecessor, Dr. Jameson came nearer to  <span style="page" id="page141">[p.141]</span> getting mad than I ever saw him, was when I asked him
if he had thought of having a guide to the guides on materials
in the Spanish archives and he said, "No, sir, somebody else
can tackle that!" And that is something that is decidedly
needed now, a guide to the guides to the Spanish archives alone.

An illustration comes, for example, in the omission
in the Spanish archives of enclosures and of letters from
subordinate officials to the main officials. You get a series
and if you look around among the different guides, you may
pretty well cover the period of Governor Carondolet
but when the Library was offered a little while ago the full
contemporary copies for purchase from a dealer, and we tried
to find those in the reproductions and the guides, they hadn't
been copied, and we were put to it to know whether this was
worth the money asked or not, because we hadn't anything
directly to compare it with. We could find guess work here,
that part of the letters were in one guide, part of them we
might have transcripts of, very few; but the principle of
selection at widely scattered times, by individuals, for
different reasons and different motives, had produced a situation that was exceedingly unfortunate and caused a great deal
of delay and a great deal of annoyance.

So I want to reinforce as strongly as I can---I am <span style="page" id="page142">[p.142]</span> sorry to differ with Dr. Buck---the necessity of the preliminary
work Dr. Bemis has spoken of. Without not merely the guides,
but without the planning and the study that lies behind those
and the concentration of that in the skilled hands and the
leadership of Dr. Jameson, the three million pieces we have
now in the way of transcripts and the thousands that we are
asked now to reproduce---so much so that we are asked now that
California and other places shall make microfilms of our
transcripts from the Spanish archives---that would have been
impossible without that forethought.

In contrast to that, we have the scheme that was
mentioned by one of the other speakers this afternoon, of Mr.
Lathrop, which was published in a very neat little article, a
very interesting article, which showed great enterprise on the
part of this Texas project to make a selection of southern
material. I have the greatest regard for the energy and the
ability with which Mr. Lathrop and Mrs. Lathrop started up,
but I hate to think of what the next scholar who wants just
the things that they omitted, is going to think of that
selection when he comes along and wants to examine into it.
Forethought and planning is the major part of their proposition.

With all due respect to the technic, the microfilming is only an incident. We have hand transcripts, we <span style="page" id="page143">[p.143]</span> have typewritten transcripts, we have photostatic,we have
microfilms and microfilm enlargements and there may be
something else invented, but let's not forget in this whole
situation that the microfilm is a means to an end, not an end
in itself. In building up the approach to the end in view,
scholarship, time and long planning is the fundamental requisite.

MR. BUCK: Mr. Chairman, I am somewhat puzzled to
know just what is the conflict between what I said and what Dr.
Sioussat said I said that he disagrees with, because I find
myself in hearty agreement with everything he has said.

MR. SIOUSSAT: I understood you to say you thought
it was better to go ahead at once with large planning and not
wait for guides.

MR. BUCK: No, no, no, what I said was the thing
to do now is to assemble by microphotography the existing
guides in the shape of manuscript lists, catalogues and inventories, of European libraries and archives, and South American
libraries and archives as the basis for just the comprehensive
sort of planning that you have been speaking of.

CO-CHAIRMAN LELAND: The Chair rules that Mr. Buck
and Mr. Sioussat are in complete accord with each other, each
more than the other. (Laughter) <span style="page" id="page144">[p.144]</span>

MR. SIOUSSAT: That isn't what I mean by guides.

MR. BUCK: I have here in my hands a translation of
an article written by a member of the staff of the Bibliothèque
Nationale entitled in translation, "Libraries and the War."
Our Reporter obtained this article in French, and it has been
translated at the National Archives, and it describes the
activities that have gone on in that institution in the boxing
up and removing to storage in distant parts of the country of
what are considered the more important parts of that library
and other libraries in Paris; and also there is a statement in
the end that the same process has been carried on in most of
the archival establishments in Paris. That would indicate
that at present, at least, much of the material that we would
be interested in reproducing would probably not be available
for reproduction, another reason why we need to devote our
attention for the time being, perhaps, so far as European
material is concerned, to planning rather than to rushing into
large-scale reproduction of archival material.
There is another feature of this paper that I think
is pertinent in this connection, and that is the statement that
the use of microphotography for the preservation of documentary
material has also been undertaken in connection with the
existing crisis, and I might read a sentence or two: "We have <span style="page" id="page145">[p.145]</span> used this method in reproducing the only catalogue in existence of the Library of the National Conservatory of Music.
This reproduction appeared all the more necessary because
certain parts of the catalogue, notably those concerning
unique documents, ancient music, the music of King's Chapel
and of the Revolution, hold great interest for all musical
libraries. These cards reproduced on 35 mm. film, are now
available.

Thus we see that European scholars are interesting
themselves in putting some of these catalogues and inventories
and lists that exist only in manuscript form on microcopy,
and consequently I think we can see the possibilities of
obtaining their cooperation in projects of that sort.

MR. BEMIS: Mr. Chairman, anent what Mr. Buck says,
I think it takes something like this European war to persuade the average archivist of the desirability of doing that
sort of thing, and while I am heartily in agreement with his
proposal to photograph these manuscript inventories and guides,
I think that a great deal of blandishment, intimacy and
diplomatic contrivance of one sort or another is necessary to
get permission to do that in the average library of Latin
America or the average archives there, first because these
people are a little ashamed of the rather pitiful manuscript <span style="page" id="page146">[p.146]</span> inventories they have, and secondly because they represented
the very penetralia of these establishments that they
preside over. They are very jealous about it. I think
it is easy to talk about getting them photographed; it is
a little more difficult to do it. If it can be done, however,
I am all for it.

MR. POWER: Mr. Chairman, this past summer I arranged
with the directors of the Laurentian Library in Florence to
photograph the manuscript library of the manuscripts of the
Convent of San Marco. That is the only catalogue in existence
of the manuscripts which that library took over from San Marco.
I announced in the Journal of Documentary Reproduction that
it was available at the nominal price of 70 cents, and so far I
have received no requests for it. I did send ten copies around
gratis.

CO-CHAIRMAN LELAND: Perhaps you will find some
orders when you get back!

MR. POWER: My point is this:
My point is this: If you can photograph
those manuscript catalogues which exist in abundance, especially
in Italian libraries, not only do you have a source of information or data over here which one can use to compile lists for
ultimate photography, but those same catalogues could also be
distributed to anyone who wished it and when combined with <span style="page" id="page147">[p.147]</span> photographic equipment in the country it means that the items
listed in that catalogue can then be secured upon individual
order for any person who may want them before they are photographed on any large-scale project.

CO-CHAIRMAN LELAND: Before we get entirely away
from the question of South America, I wish Mr. Leonard would
give us his views about copying in South America. We have
had it discussed chiefly from the viewpoint of the political
and economic historian and the viewpoint of the archivist.
Now, Mr. Leonard is especially interested in literary and cultural history and possibly would say something from the point
of view of the possibilities of the library.

MR. LEONARD: From experience based on work in Lima
and Santiago and Buenos Aires, I am rather reluctantly brought
around to agreeing with what has been said by several speakers.
I am afraid that perhaps the best plan would be to take
census of the materials that we have in this country first, to
find out what we have; and in the second place, to fill in
the gaps from Seville, in Spain; and then third, to work in
the archives of Spanish America itself. I am speaking mainly
of those on the west coast.

We might hope that while these preliminary steps
were being made, that the archives, for example, in Lima, <span style="page" id="page148">[p.148]</span> would make some progress on finding out what it has got itself.
I think the archives in Lima are probably the richest, certainly for the colonial period, of any of the South American
archives.
Unfortunately, they are in an exceedingly chaotic
state because I have found documents of as many as four centuries in one bundle, so what you find is usually largely by
chance. There is no guide to help you very much, except some
pitiful manuscript one such as Dr. Bemis has spoken of.

It seems to me that one of the first steps would be
to try to prevail upon the authorities there to undertake a
more systematic examination of their own archives and compile
some sort of a guide to it with outside assistance, perhaps.
But before you can proceed to photographing material, especially
if it is done on the project basis, that is a more or less
limited project, the difficulties of locating the material,
from the standpoint of time, would be enormous in a place like
Lima.

CO-CHAIRMAN LELAND: How about photographing books
from the Medina collection in Santiago? Is there a great
deal of material we haven't got that is unique and could be
easily identified?

MR. LEONARD: I think books offer a little different
and simpler problem, especially in Santiago, because the <span style="page" id="page149">[p.149]</span> archive there is better organized than in Lima, and the
library is relatively well organized and that Medina collection
is set aside in a room of its own, a very large collection,
so it is relatively easy to consult the books that are in that
collection, which are rare imprints from the colonial period,
from all the different countries of Latin America.

CO-CHAIRMAN LELAND: Would you find there is a great
deal we haven't got?

MR. LEONARD: I would be inclined to think we would,
yes, find a good many volumes we did not have, although there
again it would probably be wise to take some sort of a census of
what we have in this country here, consulting the Union
Catalogue at least. But I think that would be a very fruitful
place to work from the point of view of getting imprints of
the colonial period. Lima would also be useful, but it would
be much more difficult to find your books. They are not all
together in one room as they are in Santiago.

MR. WATSON DAVIS: Mr. Chairman, I have here, with
the permission of the Department of State, a communication
which has direct reference to the problem that Dr. Bemis and
Dr. Leonard have mentioned; that is, in Guatemala, the
Director of the National Archives, Senor Pardo, has made known
to our mission there that he would welcome microfilming and <span style="page" id="page150">[p.150]</span> depositing in the appropriate agency in the United States a
considerable portion of the documents in his charge. The
complete letter is here. He has no assistants, not even a
typist. He is cataloguing more than 400,000 letters, royal
decrees and other documents of historical interest relating
to Central America and Mexico. He has a Leica camera. He has
to buy his own film, and he is described in this as a gentleman of middle age who possesses a love for his work as well as
an understanding of the requirements for its proper conduct,
and so forth. It seems to me that this might be a practical
point of departure, and I might add that this letter is confidential, but permission has been secured to present it to this
conference.

CO-CHAIRMAN LELAND: Thank you very much, Mr. Davis.

Mr. Jameson, you were going to say something.

MR. JAMESON: I rise merely hoping the conference
might get off South America for a moment. I have just returned
from an extensive trip among the American colleges to find out
in part, among other things, what was needed to stimulate
research, and the call there is for microfilm copies of European periodicals of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries.
I was astonished at how unanimous the feeling was that those
were needed. I consulted in three universities the directors <span style="page" id="page151">[p.151]</span> of the schools of literature, and they estimated 90 per cent
of the time of students is spent in reading
periodicals,
and if a selection of European periodicals could be produced
in this country it would save an enormous amount of time, and
prepare the students better for the European trip. I would
like to have that discussed, if relevant.

MR. BEMIS: That couldn't be done right now under
the existing situation in Europe.

MR. JAMESON: Quite a bit could be done.

CO-CHAIRMAN LELAND: It could be done from provincial
collections where you will find periodicals that would also be
in metropolitan collections.

One is rather impressed by examining the Union
Catalogue of periodicals, I mean the Union list of serials,
holdings of serials, to see how many gaps there are in our
holdings. I mean how many European periodicals we haven't got
at all or have only broken files of.

MR. JAMESON: I know half a dozen French and Italian
libraries fairly well, and I know many of the things we need
can be gotten there. You don't have to go to Paris or London
for them.

MR. BEMIS: I am assuming that this catastrophe in
Europe is going to be pretty wide-spread, and that librarians <span style="page" id="page152">[p.152]</span> will be closing up their libraries, sand-bagging them or what
not, and won't want to be bothered during the present war.

MR. JAMESON: It is an assumption we can't consider.
The provincial libraries are likely to stay open. Their
collections are local and large.

MR. DANTON: Mr. Jameson prompts me to ask a question
which I suspect represents or would represent something of the
minority point of view, which has been turning over in my
mind ever since the discussion started this evening, and that
question is: Must we in effect give up, as apparently would
be the consensus of opinion here so far expressed, all idea of
photographing, at least on a fairly large scale, in Europe?
I suppose no one here has any real knowledge of the extent to
which a major project might be put into effect in Europe, and
certainly no one is under any illusions as to the obstacles to
any such major program; and yet if we admit, as I think we
would also, that many of the materials, perhaps not now directly threatened, are at least in potential danger of destruction,
and if we admit, as Mr. Jameson has pointed out and as many of
us know, many of those materials are not represented in American
libraries and are needed and would be used, then I come back
to my original question, should we, simply because of the
magnitude of the problem and the undoubted difficulties and <span style="page" id="page153">[p.153]</span> obstacles that would be placed in the way of a partial solution, give up all idea of trying to operate in Europe?

There are still countries more or less unaffected;
there are still many libraries in which photographic operations
could be carried on. Spain is one, of course; Sweden is
probably another. Finland now is one. The situation, of course,
will change probably from month to month, but I should be very
sorry to rule out Europe entirely.

MR. BEMIS: I should like to say the answer, just
categorically and dogmatically from my own point of view, is,
yes, we should rule out Europe. Granting the desirability of
preservation of these copies, if there was ever a period in the
history of modern times when it was going to be most difficult
to initiate a large and ambitious scale of reproduction of
material in Europe, we are now in the midst of that. Anybody
who has tried to negotiate with foreign governments to secure
these very particular privileges which are necessary to work
in archives and official libraries in times of profound peace
must realize from the beginning that a person who is soliciting
such favors now is nothing more than a nuisance, a first-class
nuisance. I would never undertake to try to do it personally
in such times.

I dogmatically will say that no one would be welcome <span style="page" id="page154">[p.154]</span> in Europe who attempted to do this sort of thing, even in a
neutral country, so-called, now. It is all right to formulate
this. If they aren't blown up or destroyed in the present
war, then it would be all right later on to try to do something
about it, but if ever times called for going easy on such an
ambitious program, the present times call for that.

Further, such a large project is going to be awfully
expensive, and money isn't going to come so easily right now
anywhere in the United States. I think it is strategically
just the wrong time to try to do anything big in Europe. If
we just keep along there with a trickle of work for the present
it is about all that can be hoped for, so I answer that very
pessimistically, I am afraid dogmatically, but I don't see
any chance of doing it at all to any great extent, unless
possibly in Spain.

MR. HILL: You can't get into Spain right now.

MR. TILLEUX: Dr. Leland, I think possibly in part
of our discussion right now, the direction of it could be
changed if we had a little bit more definite commitment as to
what we can expect, whether it is South America or Europe.
I would like to ask the question, to what extent have the
various curators of archival institutions been approached, and
to what extent have they indicated a willingness and agreeableness <span style="page" id="page155">[p.155]</span> to letting us come in? Dr. Watson Davis has read to us
a part of a communication which indicates this poor scholar
working all alone would welcome a chance to have his materials
permanently recorded. I suspect that may be a rather isolated
instance. One person can fall in love, but it takes two to
make a marriage.

We are sitting here talking about what we would like
to do in Europe or Central America. I am wondering whether
the curators' attitude or the persons having the collections,
would not operate against your getting them if you tried.
I would like that brought out in the open.

CO-CHAIRMAN LELAND: About that we can only speculate.

MR. SCHOLES: I would like to at least record some
information about Spain, in the first place. A year ago this
spring at the end of the Civil War, the Carnegie Institution
tried to get permission for a member of our staff to enter
Spain to do work in Seville. We thought that would be a
formality, due to the fact that the President of our Board
of Trustees is Mr. Cameron Forbes, who is very close to the
Franco government, but up to the present time we have not
even had a reply from the Spanish Embassy to that application.
The only person I know to be able to operate in Spain is Mr.
Morrison, and I suspect he got in because he was captain of a <span style="page" id="page156">[p.156]</span> ship that sailed up a river.

We have had 2,000 feet of film in Seville for a year
and a half and haven't had a single picture made yet.

With regard to Pardo in Guatemala, there is no doubt
he is an extremely active and conscientious person. He has
practically made that archive what it is today. But in any work
we do in Latin America, whether in Guatemala or Mexico or South
America, so far as it affects the colonial period, you ought to
recognize in advance that you are getting secondary materials,
that is secondary from the standpoint of importance, that if you
had your choice you would go to Seville first. There are, however, certain classifications of materials, at least, in
Mexico, in the archives I know best, that could be photographed
without a great outlay in time or money, and certainly in the
case of the Mexican archive, I know of no objection on the part
of the staff that would prevent us from doing that.

CO-CHAIRMAN LELAND: I saw Dr. Mayer trying to get
the floor a minute or two ago.

DR. MAYER: I believe we should not give up the large-scale idea because things have gone as they have in Europe or
Asia, because I believe the aim of this conference is to save
everything that is possible, not for the present but for the
future generation. We cannot ourselves on selective basis <span style="page" id="page157">[p.157]</span> say that we want to microfilm certain definite portions of the
Public Record Office, or, for instance, an archive in Spain,
or a certain class of books or a certain class of manuscripts.
We should make our plan on a really wholesale basis. We are
here as members of the conference with individual interests:
one wants to have different newspapers microfilmed; another
wants literature published in China. I want all the medical
books and medical manuscripts. One single factor which unites
us is that we should have Union lists or a world catalogue of
the books published and the guide to all the different archives
and public depositories, and to establish such a Union list
will take at least five or six years.

I don't know how long the European war will last, but
if we would begin with that wholesale project right now, then
probably after five years we would be in position to go ahead
and microfilm everything possible.

The Army Medical Library wants to establish, in fact
we have begun already to establish, a Union list and at the
same time a world list of all medical publications. Other
libraries and other archives probably could take up some other
part of the problem and establish some subject catalogues for
their own field, and finally all these subject catalogues
would be united in one large catalogue which maybe would form <span style="page" id="page158">[p.158]</span> the basis for the American Institute of Bibliography, or some
future institute which then could start microfilming expeditions to various countries.
But even for the present time I
believe it would be possible to send microfilming expeditions
to certain European countries---for instance, I may mention my
old country, Hungary. I know the conditions there; they will
not go into war, and there are many manuscripts there of historical interest or medical interest, manuscripts from the Middle
Ages, and there are many rare prints and incunabula which this
country does not have. But before deciding what to microfilm,
we should have, first, a knowledge of what we really have at
the present time in the country.

MR. SWINGLE: I would like to say one word about
South America. The Royal Library of Portugal is in Rio de
Janeiro; when the royal family moved to Brazil in the Napoleonic
War they moved the library with them and left on such short
notice the library is still there, and many valuable documents
on colonial history and navigations of the Portuguese are in
the library in Rio de Janeiro. The librarian is a scholarly
man who would cooperate easily with us.

Furthermore, I want to say we know next to nothing
about the great exploring expeditions all through the Plateau
of Brazil, that have been going on there for five centuries, <span style="page" id="page159">[p.159]</span> and those are of great interest to us, because from commercial standpoint our interest in South America is very, very
great in that tropical plateau of Brazil where all the things
we now buy from the East are available without difficulty. Those
books can be obtained, and there are only two decent Portuguese
libraries in America, one in Harvard and the other in Catholic
University in Washington. Most libraries have no Portuguese
books of value. I have inspected those books of early exploratory expeditions and they are extremely interesting and extremely valuable today, and nine-tenths of them are not represented
anywhere in America. Those are accessible without difficulty
and could be copied at the low price of perhaps a cent or two a
page.

I took down one of these projectors for Davis. I had
great difficulty in retaining possession of it. They were enthused about it and wanted to keep it in the office of the
Minister of Foreign Affairs. The Department of Agriculture
raised the money first and took it.

What I want to say is that the feeling of Brazilians
toward the United States is different from any other country I
ever traveled in, and I have lived for years in Europe. They
are most remarkably friendly and they will go further than
almost any other foreign country to cooperate with us. That I <span style="page" id="page160">[p.160]</span> know because I went there myself as a Brazilian official. I
was hired by the Brazilian Government to advise them, I didn't
go as an American at all, and I am in a position to speak from
experience on this point. Everywhere I found the most extreme
interest in the little photostat pamphlets I took with me. I
was impressed with the quality of the work they were doing
there and I said, "How did you do that?" and they showed me
the work they were doing. I think you could greatly increase
your low-cost harvest by getting those valuable early books
of the Portuguese explorations. The Guarani Indians had a real
civilization. There is a dictionary which gives the most
extraordinary insight into their knowledge of nature. Eight-tenths of the place names in Southern Brazil are Guarani.

Our own interest there is so great that an appropriation of $1,000,000 has been made available for immediate use
to try to grow rubber in the New World. That is a sample of
the thing this country is bound to do. We are interested in
the tropical part of South America where we can hope to produce
millions of dollars worth a year of tropical plants which we
import from distant countries like the Dutch East Indies.

MR. SCHWEGMANN: It seems likely we could crystallize
into action some of the opinions that have been expressed if
we knew just a little bit the answer to these questions. The <span style="page" id="page161">[p.161]</span> first one is: How much money is likely to be available for
any copying project? The second one is: Can't we differentiate
between the idea of copying archives and copying books? Archive
apparently would have to be prepared before copying to make
them worth anything to the students using them later on in the
microfilm. The matter of books is comparatively simple. We
could check, for instance, the Bibliothèque Nationale catalogues against the Union Catalogue of the Library of Congress.
It wouldn't be conclusive but we could eliminate thousands of
French articles. The same is true of the British catalogue.

It may be interesting to know that a relatively
small percentage of books published in South America today are
finding their way into the United States. We checked the Union
Catalogue, or rather checked the accretions of the Bibliotheca
Nacional at Colombia against the Union Catalogue, and less
than 14 per cent of the books published in Colombia today are
to be found in the Union Catalogue, which apparently means that
very few of those books are coming into the United States.
So I submit if we know about how much money we have to spend and
whether we want to spend it on manuscript reproduction or on
book reproduction, we might formulate some program.

CO-CHAIRMAN LELAND: Those are problems of course
for the Continuation Committee to look into. I have no idea <span style="page" id="page162">[p.162]</span> how much money might be available, whether any money will be
available, but if good projects are formulated I should
imagine they would find support if circumstances permitted,
and I think the point that we must think of books as well as of
archival materials of course is well made. We have been
hearing a good deal from the historians and they think in terms
very largely of archives, naturally, and there are one or two
interests here that haven't been very vocal as yet. Mr. Post,
you have come representing the interests of medievalists.

MR. POST: I simply want to say I am naturally in
favor of preserving manuscripts that are unpublished, manuscripts which offer access only to new copies. As for books,
except for certain incunabula and very rare books we can buy
them in South America. I don't think we need to spend our
time bothering about the expense of photography. As for manuscripts of the early period, I am convinced we must be selective, but they are the first desideratum after photographing
the documents in archives.

It is no simple problem to photograph a manuscript.
It is not sufficient to photograph manuscript catalogues in
European libraries. Where manuscript catalogues are published
we can get copies. The manuscript catalogues are totally
inadequate for the average scholar. The expert has to go <span style="page" id="page163">[p.163]</span> through the manuscripts themselves to know what kinds of
materials are in the manuscripts, and it is the scholars who
have to do that, and really the discussion of that problem
comes under Section IV and not Section III. Hence, I haven't
caught it up here. Nevertheless, straight selection by
scholars, probably chosen from all fields, has to be done.

As for Union lists, bibliographies of bibliographies
of libraries, and bibliographies of bibliographies of bibliographies, I have used them enough to find I have very little
faith in them.

CO-CHAIRMAN LELAND: Mr. Davies, you have come from
a distance and you represent an institution particularly interested in the study of the Renaissance.

MR. GODFREY DAVIES: I would like to say in regard
to the problem of photographing manuscript indexes, like Mr.
Lunt, I have worked in the Record Office all my adult life, and
they are useful but they are by no means indispensable. I find
I can get the document, or I could before the war broke out,
by ordering it from California just as well as I could when I
was in the Record Office.

The next point I would like to make is that people
have been talking about the possibility of microfilming national
archives. I would like to say a few words about that from the <span style="page" id="page164">[p.164]</span> English point of view. I don't know much about other archives.
If you photographed all that was in the Record Office, you
would not have a very high percentage, not above I suppose
perhaps 60 per cent, of what are, properly speaking, the national archives. Queen Elizabeth toward the end of her reign laid
down the rule that when great officers of state retire, they
should leave behind in the state paper office their official
documents. Anybody acquainted with English history knows how
badly that was done. If you want to get the state papers for
English history, you have to go to all kinds of places.

If I may take just a few of the leading figures of
the late Tudor and early Stuart period, the great figure of
course in Elizabeth's reign apart from the Queen herself
was Burleigh. Many of Burleigh's papers are at Hatfield, many
of them are among the Lansdowne manuscripts in the British
Museum, and there are some outlying ones. You wouldn't have
a half or a quarter of them, I believe, if you photographed
all that are in the Record Office.

The same applies to his son, Robert Cecil, the
Minister until his death in 1612.

Take the case of Elizabeth's Lord Keeper of the Jails,
Lord Ellesmere; many of his manuscripts are in Huntington Library
some are still in the possession of his family and those are <span style="page" id="page165">[p.165]</span> legal manuscripts. The notes of his star chamber are full
of the drama as well as the economic and official political
history. They are in the Huntington Library.

All the Wentworth papers, or practically all, are in
the possession of Earl Fitzwilliam who until recently refused
all access to them.

The state papers for the Commonwealth and Protectorate are nearly all in the Bodleian, as are the Thurloe state
Papers and the Clarendon state papers.

If I went down the list, you would be surprised
how many of the papers of English statesmen are not in the
Record Office at all.

One contribution I think we might make, even in time
of war, supposing that all access to English records could
be had, whether in the Record Office or private possession,
would be to try to compile a list of the great officers of
state---I speak only of those from 1485---and try to ascertain
as nearly as we can where their papers and and to what extent
they are in print, or where they are described, whether
they are described by the Historical Manuscript Commission
or elsewhere. That I think would be a real service to scholarship. Of course, if the British National Bibliography were up
to date and if all the authors were conscientious, we would <span style="page" id="page166">[p.166]</span> have all the information I desire there, so far as it was
true fifty or sixty years ago, but even the more conscientious
authors fifty or sixty years ago state where their manuscripts
were then, which is very little use to us now. I would like
very much to see some listing of that kind undertaken.

CO-CHAIRMAN LELAND:
We have been discussing back and
forth over III and IV. There is one point I think that we
might discuss a little, which is given under No. 9 here, end
which is perhaps rather badly out in the agenda, which reads,
"Should emphasis be placed on (a) Copying in anticipation of
need? or (b) For specific needs of individuals or groups?"
And the further question is asked, "Should both purposes be
recognized as of equal importance?"

I suppose it can be assumed whatever else we do, we
do want to have some system whereby individuals can secure
promptly and inexpensively the materials that they need. I
imagine there would be no differences of opinion about that,
would there, that such a service would need not interfere in any
way with any large-scale projects that were being planned but
that it is a service which has been inaugurated? This afternoon
we found three such services in existence and I should suppose
the opinion of this conference would be that such services
should be maintained and improved so far as possible, so the <span style="page" id="page167">[p.167]</span> individual can secure what he needs as promptly and as inexpensively as possible. I don't know whether that calls for
much discussion, but if there is any discussion as to where
emphasis should be placed, we would be glad to have it, but I
think most of us would agree that the two ideas have got to go
forward together.

MR. LUNT: Mr. Chairman, if I understand Project "A"---I am not sure that I do---it is photographing manuscripts in
advance of needs in somewhat the same manner as those who
have to recommend the purchase of books for college or university libraries recommend the purchase of books which we ourselves
wish to use, which our students wish to use, and a great many
which neither of us will use but which we think should be in the
library for somebody to use sometime. My suggestion would be
that a compromise might be reached between Project "A" if I
have it correct in mind and the purely individual scholar. I
think unless we are going to have to photograph right and left,
some system of selection has to be reached. My idea would be
to reach a system of selection in which we could get not only
those things which are needed immediately by individual scholars
who have projects planned and in hand and can send to a central
committee or board just what they need, but that we should also
plan for a more general future. <span style="page" id="page168">[p.168]</span>

I have in mind some such procedure as this, that
a central committee or board should canvass various learned
societies in the various disciplines and that the societies
should ask not only to get information about individual projects
already under way but should ask some of the older scholars
in the various portions of the field to indicate some of those
series of documents in various European archives which would be
of general use in that portion of the field. For example, take
the field of English constitutional history in the medieval
period; we have a large number of scholars doing research in
that field in this country. Some of them have been doing research for many years and are thoroughly familiar with the
archives and without any finding lists at all can sit down and
write out lists of series of documents, such, for example, as
the memoranda rolls of the Exchequer, that would be of
general use to almost everybody working in that field. That
central
committee then having this data at hand could compare
these lists, consult scholars further if necessary, and reach
working basis for a selective list which would be of practical
value for a good many years to come, and yet would not be
on such an expensive scale as to make it financially impossible.

MR. JAMESON: I merely wanted to point out and
emphasize the difference which was made between archival material <span style="page" id="page169">[p.169]</span> and periodical material. The two are clearly different. In
the second place, I want again to insist there is a large body
of scholars in America that need the periodical material.

MR. TILLEUX: Mr. Chairman, you mentioned the three
agencies in this country through which information could be
secured regarding the microfilming of data. I have here something which I didn't mention this afternoon because I didn't
know enough about it. It is possible some of the gentlemen
from Philadelphia may be able to tell us something. I have
this little document, "War Documentation Service," published
by the Union Library Catalogue of the University of Pennsylvania and the Bibliographical Planning Committee of Philadelphia, and the sum and substance of it is that scholarship
shall go on, war or no war. In the list of things which they
hope to do I notice films. There is no further explanation of
exactly what is meant. If this is a fourth agency for securing that information, then I think it also ought to go in the
record.

One of the gentlemen made the comment that it would
be necessary first of all to arrange manuscripts for microfilming.
Of course that is the logical thing to do if you could
go about it deliberately, but when you are working against an
advancing military frontier and you have only a few hours to <span style="page" id="page170">[p.170]</span> work, the thing to do is to film, get the film out of the
country, and then let scholars go through the stuff and pick
out those things which are significant and make indexes of them.
Microfilm can be bought with numbering edge-fogged on it so
that a particular manuscript which may run from frames 232
to 248 can be identified as frames 232 to 248 of roll No. 29 of
a certain series. That of course is not the desirable way to
go about it, but if you want the stuff, it can be had.

We also have---and we might be able to get the WPA
to consider using its workers for such a purpose---thousands of
persons who have already been trained on various WPA projects
in the calendaring of manuscripts, or in abstracting articles
in newspapers, not only American newspapers but foreign language
newspapers. There is a large project in Chicago, one in
Cleveland, another considered for Milwaukee, and we have those
persons on the rolls who can read those papers and make a
digest of the materials from them. If you want to consider
that at all, there is a possibility.

Mr. Jameson has mentioned twice the great desire of
scholars in American universities to have readily accessible
rather extensive runs of foreign periodicals, I don't know
exactly what kind of periodicals but probably scientific, and
I recall having read not long ago that an institute had been <span style="page" id="page171">[p.171]</span> planned for Oxford, England, whereby they would perform the
same type of service for European and English scholars that
Bibliofilm and Documentation Service does here, that is the
provision of files for a great period of years of selected
important scientific periodicals. As you probably know, an
endowment has made it possible for libraries which wish those
to get them at a very small cost per frame, a cent and a
half or something of that sort.

CO-CHAIRMAN LELAND: I suspect, Mr. Tilleux, Mr.
Vanderbilt or Mr. Boyd can answer your inquiry with regard to
the service you have been describing in Philadelphia.

Dr. Buck!

DR. BUCK: Mr. Chairman, I would like to underscore
one of the remarks made by Mr. Lunt with reference to the
process of selection, and that is that selection from archival
or manuscript collections for reproduction should be by series
rather than by individual documents. There are two reasons for
that, it seems to me that would apply in the main. There
might of course be exceptions. One reason would be that it is
a much simpler process to select the series than to arrange for
a scholar to go through a series and pick out the significant
documents, but the other and more important reason is that
documents selected out of a series lose some of their value <span style="page" id="page172">[p.172]</span> because of the possible interrelations with other documents
in the series. I think what Dr. Sioussat said about our
series of transcripts in which the enclosures have been omitted
is an illustration of that fact, and I should strongly advocate
that selection, if applied to archival or manuscript materials,
be on the basis of important series or groups rather than the
selection of individual documents for reproduction.

MR. WILLIAMS: I think it is pertinent to say that
the American Library Association Committee on Photographs adopted the policy in the case of manuscripts of reproducing the
whole manuscript, no matter what is in it, and the applicant
must furnish us a statement of the various articles that
may be in the manuscripts. We will furnish him the copy of
what he wants but we also, while ordering, acquire the whole
volume.

MR. HILL: Mr. Chairman, just in connection with that
and emphasizing some of this and going back to what Dr. Sioussat
said, I want to advocate that it be done, not entirely by
series, perhaps, but by unit. Whatever unit the archive has
for its material, take the whole thing; if it is a bundle or
if it is a volume or whatever it is, once you start in on
thing, do it entirely. So far as the work that was done while
I was in Spain, we did that, so we are not guilty of that part. <span style="page" id="page173">[p.173]</span>

MR. WATSON DAVIS: Mr. Chairman, with your permission
I transmitted to the membership of the American Documentation
Institute, approximately sixty members nominated by that number
of scientific and scholarly agencies, your general summary
of this conference with the request that there be a comment,
and I have ten replies, not all of which, I assure you, I
will read, but the general tenor is interesting in connection
with the point under discussion. For instance, Dr. E. J.
Crane, Editor of Chemical Abstracts, says, "If it proves to be
practicable to do anything to safeguard the present records
in Europe by microcopying, I should like to see some emphasis
placed on science as a subject, and on currently appearing
material, much of which is not now getting through to the
United States. Of course there has been a curtailment of the
current publications and some lowering in value of what which
appears, but still some useful material is being published which
American scholars and scientists should not be missing."

Herbert C. Calvery, Chief of the Division of
Pharmacology of the Food and Drug Administration, Department of
Agriculture, says: "I am sure the societies which I represent
will be very much interested in just what is available through
the American Documentation Institute in the case of inaccessible
foreign journals, and at what costs." <span style="page" id="page174">[p.174]</span>

Philip B. Bucky, the representative of the American
Institute of Mining Engineers, recommends that efforts be
made to microcopy as much of the research materials available
in foreign depositories as may be recommended by committees
to act for special scientific fields.
There are other comments that are pertinent. Here
is one from Dr. Victor S. Clark, Library of Congress, who points
out that there should be at least three considerations in the
selection of materials: (1) accessibility for this purpose;
(2) the general importance from the American standpoint; (3)
meeting the needs of specific inquiries.

Dr. Lawrence Heyl, the Acting Librarian at Princeton,
feels that the possibility of total destruction of collections
in certain localities makes it seem advisable to consider the
idea of filming all collections of manuscripts in such places.

The representative of the Medieval Academy, Dr. C. W.
David, feels that the membership of the Medieval Academy
would be most interested in microcopying of selected manuscripts, although they have some interest in books.
I would like to make these a part of the record.

CO-CHAIRMAN LELAND: Thank you very much, Dr. Davis.
If you would at some suitable time hand them to the Reporter,
they can be incorporated in the record, and we are grateful to <span style="page" id="page175">[p.175]</span> you for gathering that information.

We have heard nothing from Mr. Pettitt of the
University of California.

MR. PETTITT: I have very little to contribute to the
conference here. In fact, I feel I am getting a great deal out
of listening to the opinions and statements that are being
made.
My reason for being here is to do that on behalf of the
University, on behalf of the President of the University, and
to get a first-hand account of what the men out here on the
East Coast particularly think of the possibilities of this microfilm work so that we may take advantage of such information
in the development of our library out there and also in cooperating with eastern groups. I don't know that I have enough
first-hand information or experience in this work of microfilming of reference material at this time to make any constructive
statement.

CO-CHAIRMAN LELAND: We will be very glad to have any
suggestions from you at this time, Mr. Pettitt.

MR. KELLAR: Like Mr. Pettitt, I have listened with
a great deal of interest to the different points of view
that have been expressed. I would like to make three comments.
I think it is entirely possible that the direction of events
in Europe may mean that some original records may be sent over <span style="page" id="page176">[p.176]</span> here and if they come, it may be possible for us to copy them.
There will be many that will not come. I think that an attempt
should be made to get what we can in Europe.

With regard to the point as to the inaccessibility
of the records, this point might be made. In view of the
change in the character of the government particularly in
France and England, it is entirely possible if the matter were
approached with authorities that are high enough in authority,
that permission, or rather orders, could be given to open these
materials to us.

I think, also, that if we cannot do very much in
Europe---and I think we should try---then we should turn our
attention to South America, but it seems to me under the conditions that Europe has the first call.

CO-CHAIRMAN LELAND: We have been talking largely
about Europe and South America but nothing has been said about
Asia this evening. We know of one or two enterprises that are
going on there, and with Mr. Swingle and Mr. Hummel and Mr.
Graves here, I think before we leave this subject of distribution of effort we ought to hear at least something of the
possibilities of more intensive work in certain Asiatic cities.
Mr. Hummel, suppose you speak to that.

MR. HUMMEL: Mr. Chairman, I was wondering if you <span style="page" id="page177">[p.177]</span> were going to leave Asia out. It is in here: Asia, Latin
America, Europe, Africa and Oceania.

There is one thing to be said about the possibilities
of filming and photostating in China and Japan which I think
should be brought out; that is, that there is not that dearth
of guides that I have been hearing about here for the last
two hours. It was very strange for me to listen to your
discussion here about the difficulty of filming and photostating because you didn't know what was rare or what you could obtain. As one who has been working in the Chinese field for
many years, I think that obstacle is no obstacle at all in
getting the rarest kind of material from China and Japan.

The Chinese first issued a catalogue in the first
century B.C. and that catalogue is still in existence, and they
continued to issue catalogues every century after that, and
most of those catalogues are in print and have been in print
for many centuries. The private libraries of China nearly all
have printed catalogues. We know where the books went from
century to century and we know where the books are now. Furthermore, we know what books are rare and what books are unique.
I could within two days with my staff in the Library of
Congress compile a list of at least 200 unique items which I
know are in only one library of China or Japan. It wouldn't <span style="page" id="page178">[p.178]</span> take us any time at all to list printed books and manuscripts
which we know to be unique. There would be no guesswork about
it because the Chinese are, I suppose, the greatest bibliographers the world has ever seen. They have listed the descent,
the migration, of all their books from library to library,
and within the last twenty years all of the university libraries
have issued catalogues of their rare books. We can compare them
very easily and tell where they are now.

Many of those of course in the Peiping National
Libraries have been carried off to Northwest and Southwest
China, but there are enough rare books in Peiping today to
keep a machine busy for a long time filming unique items.

That could be placed on an exchange basis, also, I
know there are many Chinese libraries that want to have films
and photostats of unique books which we have in the Library of
Congress. We have many books there, I should say several hundred books, which are known not to be in China or Japan.
We have studied them, we have listed them and described them.
The Chinese libraries are waiting for the time when those books
will be filmed or photostated or reproduced in some way and
an exchange arrangement can take place simply with our library
here in the Library of Congress, not to speak of the other
large Chinese libraries in Cambridge and those which are <span style="page" id="page179">[p.179]</span> building up now at Chicago and Columbia. Many hundreds of
rare items, unknown even to Chinese cataloguers, have slipped
into this country in the last fifteen or twenty years and are
coming in day by day, so starting an exchange arrangement
between those libraries offers no difficulty at all and we
would avoid to a large extent any duplication because we know
where these books are and we know how rare they are because
they have been adequately described by Chinese bibliographers.

While there has been a great deal of destruction
and while books have moved in China, we wouldn't need to wait
for starting any such project between China and Japan and ourselves. I think for one reason alone they would welcome one
indication that we in the United States were interested in
their literature. I have waited all evening to find anyone
expressing an interest in their literature. Not a single one
has spoken of it. The Chinese and Japanese, too, would welcome
an indication that we would simply be interested in getting
their material. It is important to get it because 100 or more
libraries in China have moved bodily to West China, yet there
are, I think, in Peiping and Tokyo and Kyoto enough rare books
to begin on any such project any time you want to begin.

CO-CHAIRMAN LELAND: We are very glad to have that
clear and concise statement for the record. Thank you. Mr. <span style="page" id="page180">[p.180]</span> Pettitt, you are on your feet. Perhaps you want to speak to
this subject.

MR. PETTITT: I just wanted to answer the statement
made by Dr. Hummel. So far as the interest in the Oriental,
especially the Chinese, literature, we have been taking a great
interest in that, and I heard earlier this evening, during the
dinner, as a matter of fact, of the plans that have been made
to microfilm some of the Chinese collections in Peiping, and
the University of California certainly is interested in that.
I was very much interested in the statement that was made
about the oriental libraries that were building at Chicago and
Columbia, without mention of the University of California. I
think probably that reference was correct because ours is not
growing as fast as it should be, but we are vitally interested
in that particular question and I shall be glad to carry back
information on that point to California of the availability of
the microfilming project in Peiping.

CO-CHAIRMAN LELAND: I suggest maybe you can talk
with Mr. Graves about the work being done at Peiping Medical
College through the Draeger apparatus which was made for this
Council and has been set up there.

Mr. Swingle, you started all this business about
getting Chinese books. <span style="page" id="page181">[p.181]</span>

MR. SWINGLE: Mr. Hummel has expressed my ideas
exactly. I can add only a few words to what he has said, that
it seems as though China is the only foreign country that
has a first-class photostat machine that we can operate at a
very low cost, for the reason that our money now in China
is worth about ten times as much as it was a few years ago, and
we can buy books and we can get help at a ridiculously low
cost. Those books are right in libraries in Peiping. It is
only a question of a few books and bringing them to a fireproof building of the Peiping Union Medical College and having
them photographed. Those books are books we need badly. I
speak with some feeling because in our Department of Agriculture
I have, myself, spent $100,000 accumulating and translating
Chinese books on agriculture.
We have the best collection
on that of any single library in the world, and we have the
only library that is extensively translated with annotations
so that it means something.

Both in the Bureau of Plant Industry concerned with
the new crops that we can get from China, and in the Soil
Conservation Service concerned with the records of erosion in
Northwest China, we have come across the very urgent need for
additional literature of a kind that costs little but which is
not on sale, so there is a continuation project. We have <span style="page" id="page182">[p.182]</span> already the second largest medical collection in the world of
Chinese district records. They have roughly 2,000 districts
with populations nearly as large as our Congressional districts
and those districts have these local histories which are amazing manuals of topographic production, agriculture, forestry,
geographical information of all kinds, absolutely necessary
for all research work on Chinese history that goes back to
fundamental points. We need those badly. We can get them at
ridiculously low cost, probably less than $1 apiece, and at
such a low cost that Dr. Hummel would not hesitate to buy
them if they came on sale perhaps ten or fifteen years later,
but we have them now and can use them.

This really can be called a large-scale continuation
project and one where our interests are great. Take the case
of a single new crop. We sent two experts to China and Korea
and Manchukuo to explore the soy-bean. They hired Chinese
helpers and experts. They traveled one solid year and parts
of two other years, and brought back 6,000 packages of soy-beans---2,000 varieties. Now we realize without that large collection we never could have made a start on the soy-bean
industry. Last year it covered 9,000,000 acres, the largest of
the new crops in the South. Only half the crop was harvested,
half was fed to stock where it grew. The half that was <span style="page" id="page183">[p.183]</span> harvested sold for more than $80,000,000---a crop that didn't
exist in America a few years ago, and our exploration was aided
by the books in the Library of Congress, the fact that we
could give our explorers first-hand information as to where to
go. There are varieties we don't yet have, varieties from
Southern China, but most of our interest in agriculture is in
Northwest China. These district histories give us precise
and definite information as to where these crops are grown.
Since they cost little, since they have a high value, since
they have a permanent interest, I think we should get them.

CO-CHAIRMAN LELAND: It seems to me we ought to make
this operation self-supporting out of the profits. I wonder if
Mr. Graves has anything to add to this part of the discussion.

MR. GRAVES: I have nothing to add to the two
statements about the Far East. Has anybody mentioned the Near
East? I should think Istanbul and Cairo would be a place
to start. There are 32,000 Arabic titles in Istanbul.

MR. BEMIS: No one has said anything about Oceania
yet.

CO-CHAIRMAN LELAND: I was waiting for some representative of Oceania to sneak up.

MR. POST: I think we are agreed, or at least we
should be agreed by this time, that we shouldn't confine <span style="page" id="page184">[p.184]</span> ourselves to one country. Consequently, it seems all the more
important that we should follow such a scheme as Mr. Lunt
suggested, a highly selective scheme which would make up a
start in unpublished materials in all of the important countries
of the world, but *unpublished* materials.

CO-CHAIRMAN LELAND: Perhaps you would accept
published materials that are unique, like the Chinese books we
have been hearing about.

MR. POST: Yes, certainly.

CO-CHAIRMAN LELAND: I think we have really telescoped these two main sections, Section III on general
considerations and Section IV, problems in selection. We
haven't exhausted Section IV, however, and I think perhaps
we have reached a good stopping place tonight. It is now a
quarter to ten and I believe in this heat and under the circumstances and considering the fact that we have been at work
since two o'clock this afternoon, we shall soon reach the point
of diminishing returns, even in a conference as brilliant and
alert as this. So I am going to exercise my authority as
Chairman, with the consent of the other Chairman, to bring
this conference to a close for this evening.

However, I think I can clean up No. 10 without any
help from the audience. The question is, "How far can the <span style="page" id="page185">[p.185]</span> use of existing facilities and the development of exchanges
of material reduce the cost of projects?" I should certainly
suppose every possible use of existing facilities, both in
this country and in the foreign countries, would be resorted
to in any plans that any Committee might draw up. I think
that hardly needs discussion but it is put down here in order
to emphasize the possibility of it.

Tomorrow morning we shall go on with Section IV, at
least such parts of it as we haven't covered yet. We really
have discussed a good deal of this problem of selection. We
seem to have reached the conclusion that is one of the most important parts of the whole problem before us. I don't know that
it is going to be useful to try to follow very exactly the
analysis which I have given here. I find it is almost impossible to follow any analysis of this sort in discussion, but
I think if we start tomorrow morning thinking we will spend
the first hour in further consideration of the problem of
selecting materials, and then go on to the last two main sections, the problems of organization, direction and support of
copying operations, and the problem of receipt, storage and
servicing of materials, that we can proceed that way. I think
we might realize that in those last two sections we can only
discuss rather general considerations; we can express general <span style="page" id="page186">[p.186]</span> views with regard to them. Any definite plans will have to
be drawn up by a committee which will be set up for that
purpose, and that makes me think that this would be a proper
time to announce a part at least of the composition of the
Continuation Committee.

We are asking Mr. Metcalf, Director of the Harvard
University Library and Chairman of the A.L.A. Committee on
Photographic Reproduction of Materials to serve as Chairman of
that Committee, and he has kindly consented to do so. Mr.
Tate of the National Archives and Editor of the Journal of Photographic Reproduction has kindly consented to serve as Reporter
and Secretary of that Committee. We also hope that Mr. Stewart
the Director of the Committee on Scientific Aids to Learning
of the National Research Council will be willing to serve on
the Committee, as well as Mr. Lydenberg who is at present the
Chairman of the Joint Committee on Materials for Research of
the Social Science Research Council and the Council of Learned
Societies, and we hope that Mr. Kellar who is at present
Chairman of the American Historical Association's Committee
on Research Materials, and also Chairman of the Advisory Committee of Historic Records Survey, will be willing to serve
as a member of the Committee. Other members of the Committee
will be announced after further consultation. <span style="page" id="page187">[p.187]</span>

It is understood that this Committee must in the
beginning at least be a small committee.
It will doubtless
have power to add to its members and to add corresponding
members if it feels it expedient to do so because it must communicate with persons in distant parts of the country, and yet
the Committee as a whole must be able to meet with reasonable
ease and convenience and without too much expense.

The Committee will probably after it gets started
have to work a good deal through sub-committees, and so the
entire personnel that will center around this Committee will
of course be much larger than the personnel indicated in the
five members of the Committee whose names I have mentioned just
now.

I think we might consider our task for tonight as
having been completed and if there is no objection, adjourn
to meet tomorrow morning at the Library Building. Let's try
to get there at half past nine because it may be difficult to
close at twelve-thirty unless we meet as promptly as possible.

...The meeting adjourned at nine forty-five o'clock...

<span style="page" id="page188">[p.188]</span>

THURSDAY MORNING SESSION

June 6, 1940

The meeting was called to order at nine-thirty
o'clock by Co-Chairman Leland.

CO-CHAIRMAN LELAND: I think we can complete the appointment of the Continuationg Committee by adding the names
of Mr. MacLeish and Mr. Schwegmann.
That gives us a Continuation Committee for the time being of seven members: Mr. Metcalf,
Chairman, Mr. Tate as Reporter, Mr. Stewart, Mr. Lydenberg,
Mr. Kellar, Mr. MacLeish and Mr. Schwegmann.

The Committee will probably have to increase its numbers, either by coöpting additional members or by appointing
corresponding members and certainly it will have to organize
a series of sub-committees perhaps through such organizations
as the councils or the societies in the various field. But it
seems to me that yesterday afternoon and last evening displayed
first of all the great variety of opinion we had due very
largely to the great diversity of need that we feel. The
persons who are interested in research which is based upon
archives have of course one sort of need; persons who are interested in research based upon books have needs that will be met
in quite a different way; and persons like the medievalists
whose research work is dependent upon the use of manuscripts <span style="page" id="page189">[p.189]</span> have still another need, and there is another need we didn't
speak of last night and that is the people in the field of
the arts, anthropology, archeology, ethnology, who used three-dimensional objects. We have been discussing so far only plane
surfaces, the reproduction of plane surfaces, but there is
the problem, for instance, of reproducing vases which are very
fragile things and which can be reproduced now in stereoscopic
fashion, in color, providing students at a distance from great
collections with almost a perfect substitute for the original,
at least a better substitute for the original if they have to
look at it through a glass in a case. That sort of need hasn't
been discussed at all, and probably technical processes have
got to be devised in order to meet needs of that sort.

We observed last night when we separated that we had
been rather telescoping major Sections III and IV and it is
inevitable that that should be done. We considered the
general problem and we also considered problems of the selection of materials, and I should say the discussion has been
about equally divided between the objects of Section III and
the objects of Section IV. But I think we concluded that we
had about finished the discussion of Section III, as well as
made good progress in Section IV, and the first thing we would
do this morning would be to conclude our discussion of Section <span style="page" id="page190">[p.190]</span> IV. I think here we have to realize that about all we can do
is to suggest some of the various ways in which the needs of
scholars in all the different fields can be formulated; in
other words, the ways in which the program is to be organized.
A program is going to be a very complicated thing because it is
going to consist of a great many entirely different objectives
which have to be reached in different ways. The important
thing, it seems to me, is that the program should be conceived
of as a whole in spite of the variety of execution of its
different parts, and that is the problem of the Continuation
Committee, to try to encompass all the needs that exist in an
important way and to try to formulate a program which will embrace them all, and at the same time devise the methods which
will vary greatly from one field of work to another for
meeting those needs. So that is where we are, as I see it, in
our discussion of IV.

I suggest without trying to follow too closely 11
and 12 that we should address ourselves in general to the
problem of selection, and we shall realize as each one speaks
that that one is speaking chiefly from the basis of his own
field of interest and of the needs and the methods that are most
likely to meet those needs in his own field. Therefore, there
is not necessarily contradiction or opposition between quite <span style="page" id="page191">[p.191]</span> different views with regard to that that may be expressed. So
let us go on with that.

Mr. Lydenberg and I have agreed that I shall preside
over the deliberations through the rest of IV, and then
Mr. Lydenberg will kindly relieve me and preside over the final
deliberations of V and VI, leaving the closing exercises to
be conducted by the Chairmen in common accord. That then, is
where we are this morning, as I see it.

MR. MILAM: Mr. Chairman, as I listened to the discussion last night I wasn't quite sure whether the specialists
in separate fields were assuming that librarians know what
books and manuscripts we have in this country, and whether
they know, themselves, in their own fields. There was no
mention, no considerable discussion at least, of the importance
of discovering what we already have. I was wondering whether
it might not be pertinent to give a few moments' talk to that
this morning, particularly with reference to the Union
Catalogue in the Library of Congress. Librarians know, and
I suspect that scholars know equally, that that is a very
imperfect instrument; excellent as it is, that it includes
only a fraction of the total materials which will eventually
be listed in it, and that as a tool which seems to me to be
basic for deciding what we need, it might very well, it seems <span style="page" id="page192">[p.192]</span> to me, have some consideration here, and I wonder whether you
would permit Mr. Schwegmann or somebody to speak briefly of
its weaknesses and how they might be remedied, if that is to
be taken into account. We don't want, presumably, to get
materials that are already here until we have got materials that
we do not have.

CO-CHAIRMAN LELAND: I suppose the problem really is,
what means have we at present for knowing what our possessions
are before we proceed to organize large plans for securing new
possessions on a large scale. That is the point, isn't it?

MR. MILAM: Yes.

MR. MacLEISH: Mr. Chairman, I am very glad Mr. Milam
has made that suggestion. Unfortunately, I was unable to hear
the discussion last night, but it was my feeling last fall when
this matter first came up as a vague prospect that one of the
most useful by-products that might turn out really to be the
principal end gain would be a knowledge of some kind as to not
only what American libraries possess, but thereby what they
do not possess, and the Chairman will recall that there was
some discussion at that time of the possibility of the various
learned societies aiding in the building of American want lists
in their fields. The reactions to that were of various kinds.
They ran all the way from the suggestion that it was <span style="page" id="page193">[p.193]</span> inconceivable to the notion that it would be very easy indeed.
But that seems to me to be a matter of the most vital importance, certainly so far as the Library of Congress is concerned
and I dare say other librarians would speak with equal frankness
so far as their libraries are concerned. We desperately
need a list of what we have in terms of what others have.
I should say that is a challenge librarians can lay on the doorstep of scholars because I don't believe we are capable of
handling it ourselves.

CO-CHAIRMAN LELAND: The librarians can tell us
what we have, and Mr. Milam's suggestion was that we should
learn something of that through hearing about the various union
catalogues that we have, beginning with the Union Catalogue in
the Library of Congress. There are other union catalogues, of
course, there is a great development of regional union catalogues and a lot of large-scale inventorying of holdings under
the auspices of the Library Association and other organizations, and we have in total, I suppose, a very large amount of
information, but we perhaps are not as aware as we should be of
the sort of information that we have, or how to use it. Mr.
Milam suggested Mr. Schwegmann should say something about the
Union Catalogue.

MR. MILAM: I suggested he say something about the

## p. 194 (#399) ############################################

weaknesses of the Union Catalogue.

CO-CHAIRMAN LELAND: I don't think it is necessary
to discuss the Union Catalogue at great length here, but if we
look at it from the point of view of trying to form an idea
as to the sources of information we have with respect to
American possessions, it would be a good idea to start with the
Union Catalogue and then I should suppose Mr. Vanderbilt would
say something about the union catalogue for which he is responsible, and others will say something about the other major
bibliographies, and aspects of that sort.

MR. SCHWEGMANN: No one knows the weaknesses of
the Union Catalogue better than I do. The Union Catalogue is
a selective catalogue. It has been designed that way from the
very beginning.
There are two approaches to our large problem
of discovering what is not in the country: one is the subject
approach, the other is the author approach. I have leaned
toward the author approach because of the fact that we already
have eight million or more different books listed by author in
the Union Catalogue. The system that I think would work very
well would be to check the Bibliothèque Nationale, the British
Museum and various bibliographies, usually arranged by author,
against the Union Catalog, which immediately would give you
a desideratum, and a tremendous one. <span style="page" id="page195">[p.195]</span>

There is another factor which might be considered.
We already have better than a million cards or titles culled
from dealers' catalogues on the theory that if a dealer found
it advisable to list a certain title in his catalogue, that
that title was probably more valuable than such titles as he
would not list. We have one alphabetical arrangement of over
one million such entries right now which could be checked again
the Union Catalogue.

The two reasons that we haven't been able to enlarge
the scope of the Union Catalogue are, first, the matter of
cost---our appropriations always have been inadequate; and
secondly, the needs of transcription, an economical means of
transcription. I will take only a moment to go into that.
I have samples of the RCA electrical transcription. I would
like to pass them about, with the statement that with labor
and material, I think those cards can be produced for less
than one-half cent apiece. I am not suggesting that such cards
would be suitable for public catalogues, but for the purpose of
conveying information from one or another library to the Union
Catalogue, I think it would be very acceptable.

As to the building up of the Union Catalogue, it is
my belief that if we could list completely the resources of the
fifty largest reference libraries in the United States, our job <span style="page" id="page196">[p.196]</span> would probably be 99 per cent accomplished.

MR. MILAM: I would like for you to indicate, if you
can, for what libraries you have complete files now.

MR. SCHWEGMANN: The Library of Congress is about the
only one that is complete.

MR. MILAM: What about New York Public?

MR. SCHWEGMANN: New York Public to the extent that
they have printed cards, since the day they commenced to print
them.

MR. MILAM: What percentage is that, do you and Mr.
Lydenberg know?

CO-CHAIRMAN LYDENBERG: At least 80 per cent in.

MR. SCHWEGMANN: I would have said 70 or 80 per cent.

MR. MILAM: I asked you a question last night which
got a rather interesting answer: "Do you have duplications of
the Philadelphia Union Catalogue?" and you said "No," and I
asked you what percentage you thought would be added, how many
cards would be new if you got all of the Philadelphia catalogue.

MR. SCHWEGMANN: We have checked and found that 34
per cent of the cards from the Philadelphia catalogue added to
our catalogue is new material. The same is true of the Cleveland
catalogue. We checked only a few trays for that.

MR. MILAM: Mr. Chairman, I wanted to bring those <span style="page" id="page197">[p.197]</span> points out, because if there are 20 or 30 per cent of the
New York Public's titles that are not here, and 30 or 40 per
cent of the titles in the Philadelphia Library are not contained in the Union Catalogue, we have no single book which is
safe to use. After the scholars make up their want lists, there
is no list you can check them against and say we do have this
in the United States and we don't have that, and it seems to me
one of the first tasks is to complete that catalogue.

CO-CHAIRMAN LELAND: There is a very specific suggestion. I should like to hear some more discussion of that
point.

MR. WILLIAMS: It just occurs to me there is a point
worth mentioning from the experience of the Modern Language
Association Committee. I am afraid we may forget that it
isn't enough to tell the scholar who wants to use the text
that the book exists somewhere in the private collections of the
United States; it isn't a solution to tell him it is in the
Newberry Library or the Huntington collection because it still
isn't available to him. The mere fact that it is in the United
States is not enough. I understand you are considering the
idea of preserving unique things so far as possible, to make
sure they are preserved, but I would like for us to keep in mind
one of the chief functions of filming is to make texts available <span style="page" id="page198">[p.198]</span> for circulation, and they are not available in a great many
cases when in the United States, so our Committee has agreed
when the text is very much needed, even when it is in the
United States, we will reproduce it for a scholar who wants it.

CO-CHAIRMAN LELAND: That is a second step, but
after all the first step is to know what there is and where it
is, and the second step is to make it available. So perhaps
we should stick to this first step because I see that point
Mr. Williams has made is of course exceedingly important and
perhaps we ought to conclude this part of the discussion as to
the best way of finding out what does exist and where it exists.

Mr. Downs, I am very glad you are ready to speak.

MR. DOWNS: There is another type of approach to this
problem of finding out what we have available, and that is
the guide book or handbook descriptive of broad classes of
material, the type of publication, for example, which was done
for the southern states under the sponsorship of the A.L.A.
Board on Resources. A similar type of guide book is projected
for New York City and the Pacific Northwest and Pacific Southwest. It is probable other regions of the country will be
covered by the Board with guide books of that type.

There are also available some very useful handbooks
of individual libraries, for instance, Hutter's Handbook of <span style="page" id="page199">[p.199]</span> the Harvard College Library, Carol Brown's guide to the
reference collections of the New York Public Library. There
has recently been published a faculty survey of the University
of Pennsylvania library collections. There is a very good book
available for the American Antiquarian Society, and a number
of other institutions have issued these individual guides.
Those of course generally do not list titles but they do describe by subject or by form of material the holdings of a region
or of an individual institution. I think they are rather useful in indicating the types of material which you will find in
any particular locality.

CO-CHAIRMAN LELAND: They constitute sort of a first
aid, don't they?

MR. DOWNS: They are rather complementary, I should
say, to the Union Catalogue. They do not replace the Union
Catalogue.

CO-CHAIRMAN LELAND: No, but they represent a first
exploration.

MR. DOWNS: Yes, exactly.

CO-CHAIRMAN LELAND: Then we have two stages here.
We have these original guides that Mr. Downs has described
which constitute a preliminary exploration of groups of resources, and then we have the Union Catalogue which describes those <span style="page" id="page200">[p.200]</span> in detail by individual titles.

MR. SCHWEGMANN: I had hoped it was common knowledge
that the Union Catalogue possessed an index to special collections in American libraries. I think we list every collection
which has been described as a collection in any source that
might reasonably be searched or thought to be searched, in the
form of Library of Congress sub-headings. We indicate more
than 6500 or 7000, as we call them, special collections. I
make use of Mr. Downs' publication because I take everything
from them and incorporate it in this list.

MR. MacLEISH: Mr. Chairman, I agree with Mr. Milam
entirely that it would be a most desirable thing to complete
the Union Catalogue. There is nothing we want to do more than
that. If he has any notions of a practical nature, I would
love to have them. But I don't take the gloomy view he takes
of the present situation. You are all familiar with Mr. Binkley's
suggestions as regards a possible method of procedure now. I
can't accept the proposal that we must wait until the Union
Catalogue is completed before we begin trying to collect or
establish want lists, because it would be quite possible to
check want lists now with various kinds of lists that are
available now, against the principal catalogues of principal
libraries, and although it would be a more laborious proceeding <span style="page" id="page201">[p.201]</span> than the use of the Union Catalogue as a single check, it
certainly isn't impossible and I think the two things must proceed together.

MR. MILAN: I don't disagree with that at all, Mr.
Chairman.

MR. METCALF: I agree with everything that has been
said about the desirability of building up the Union Catalogue,
of going on with handbooks showing the resources of libraries
throughout the country, of resources of sections of the country
of course we want to keep on with that. We want to keep in
mind the fact that the Union Catalogue has been circularizing
forty or fifty of the large libraries in the country for books
that have been asked for and have not been located. A list
goes out from Mr. Schwegmann's division here every week listing
material that somebody wants.
On the other hand, we must remember that it is possible to do a certain amount of checking before we select material
which should be filmed, that the cost of filming is not terribly
high for single items, and that we will duplicate when we film
abroad or elsewhere material that is already in this country.
It is too bad, but it is not terribly serious. Mr. Power has
been copying English books before 1550 for seventeen or twenty
libraries in the country. Harvard has been getting the films. <span style="page" id="page202">[p.202]</span> We already have some 9,000 English books before 1640, I don't
know how many before 1550, but we are glad to have the film
copies just the same to use instead of our originals in many
cases.

And then we must remember that if we select too carefully and try to check each item before we decide to copy it,
that the cost of the selection is going to be very great. It
is often cheaper to film all the books in a certain class
in a library abroad than to try to select them. The cost of
pulling out individual items is more than the cost of filming
them would be, and we must also remember that the cost of
cataloguing increases greatly when you select. If you film all
the books listed in the short title list and can use the short
title list as the catalogue, you save a good deal more than the
cost of filming. Cataloguing alone costs more than the filming
in many cases, and we need to keep those special costs in mind.

CO-CHAIRMAN LELAND: I wonder if we haven't reached
the point where we agree we all desire that the Union Catalogue
should be made as complete as possible, and that we don't need
to wait for it but that in the present state of affairs it is
cheaper actually to do copying than it is to be absolutely
sure that the thing which is being copied doesn't exist somewhere in the United States. <span style="page" id="page203">[p.203]</span>

That brings us, it seems to me, to the point of
establishing our needs of determining what we want; in other
words, of compiling our want lists. How can that be done?
Obviously, it seems to me, it is done in different ways in
different fields, because, first of all, the want is there, and
secondly, you have better controls in some fields than in others.
You know what you want better in some fields than in others.
So I wonder if we could discuss that point: How is the best
way to proceed to compile our want lists? Through what
agencies can they best be compiled?

MR. KELLAR: I think before we begin that discussion
this point ought to be brought out. In analyzing the ideas that
have been advanced in the conference, it seems to me they
fall into two categories which are not necessarily antagonistic.
One is in connection with an emergency program which will do
what it can with the present situation in Europe. The other
is the long-range programs which will extend all over the
world, and also include Europe.

It seems to me in considering the preparation of a
want list in an emergency program that we should take advantage
of the various suggestions that have been advanced; the Union
Catalogue, the consultation immediately with scholars who
know material that should be gotten, and that we should use <span style="page" id="page204">[p.204]</span> every possible means available to the profession. That is
with regard to the emergency program.

With regard to the long-range program, personally I
think the preparation of subject bibliographies is the best
and most fundamental approach, but I think in considering
what we want to do we should keep in mind an emergency program
is one thing and a long-range program is another. They are
not antagonistic and can be dovetailed one into the other.

CO-CHAIRMAN LELAND: Mr. Kellar has offered some
preliminary considerations, pointing out that in the long run
it would be desirable to have subject bibliographies but we
don't need to wait for those to be made in order to establish
emergency want lists.

MR. GODFREY DAVIES: There is another approach to
this question of need, I think. Two years ago in the
Huntington Library we had a series of conferences in the
summer on the English Renaissance. A number of scholars were
invited there for the purpose, and what we did was to take
about ten fields and devote about a week to each, the purpose
being, first of all, to find out what is, broadly speaking, the
present state of scholarship in those different fields, and
secondly, what was being done so far as we knew in those fields,
and thirdly, what remained to be done and how far it was <span style="page" id="page205">[p.205]</span> possible to do it with existing facilities.
The results were
tabulated and still exist, and of course I can't promise, I
am not the head of the Huntington Library, but I believe they
would be at the disposal of our Continuation Committee if they
were thought desirable.

I would like to point out just one or two of our
conclusions. One was that it would be almost a waste of time
to study, on the West Coast certainly, or to attempt to study,
the foreign influences on the English Renaissance. The other
point I would like to make I think would be true anywhere
in the United States, namely, that you cannot study the early
modern period of English economic history in this country
with profit in any broad lines. I remember Mr. Gay used a
phrase that stuck in my mind when he said of the fourteenth
and fifteenth centuries that he was tired of hashing over
what was in print, and it was with thanks to him that I ventured to put in my suggestion the proposal that the beginning
at least should be made in trying to microfilm some of the
legal records. He pointed out to me that the history of inclosure can be very much broadened, made more decisive, if the
legal proceedings which so often were the means of inclosures
were studied in greater detail than they hitherto have been.
He, himself, had some very interesting results from studying <span style="page" id="page206">[p.206]</span> the family papers of the Huntington Library where there are
legal documents. Copies of legal documents have yielded much
more important results than boxes and boxes of ordinary family
papers.

Another result that has come from studying papers a
little later is to show how far the statute of 1563, often
called the statute of laborers or statute of apprentices, was
enforced, and it has come out (it is not yet in print), that
it was mainly enforced by Londoners against rivals in the outports. That I think has never been stated in print and I don't
know any way you can prove that except by going through these
legal documents.

It was because of these two instances and other
instances that we came to the conclusion that we could not
study the early modern economic history with advantage with
the present facilities.

This summer we are going to have three days devoted
to another Renaissance conference in August. I am quite sure
if the results interest our Continuation Committee, again they
will be available. I can't promise; I can only express my
opinion that that would be the case.

CO-CHAIRMAN LELAND: You have given a very interesting picture of how a group of scholars in a certain field get <span style="page" id="page207">[p.207]</span> together to discover what they need in their field. In other
words, that is a part of the process of establishing these
want lists that we are discussing.

MR. POST: I wanted if I could to supplement both
what Mr. Davies has said and what Mr. Metcalf has said. As for
what Mr. Metcalf has said, I quite agree with him that there
is bound to be duplication and  that we shouldn't bother too
greatly about it, that actually what we want is speed in so far
as possible in photographing unobtainable materials for use
in this country; consequently, that we must have a procedure
that cannot wait for perfection of lists, union catalogues,
complete bibliographies, and so on, we must have a procedure
that is a little more rapid.

The machinery for that procedure seems to me to lie
in connection with what Mr. Davies said both last night and
this morning. That procedure should be to all fields connected
with the leading scholars in those fields who can very rapidly
choose important categories of sources, both in archives and
in manuscript books in libraries, who can choose those categories which we can proceed with photographing quite rapidly
without waiting for the perfection of lists.

The machinery for that seems to me to lie frequently
in the learned societies that cover most of the broad fields, <span style="page" id="page208">[p.208]</span> and that committees on research on those learned societies,
as we have done in the Medieval Academy, can, I think, without
too great a waste of effort, choose those important selections
of sources we want copied.

CO-CHAIRMAN LELAND: I want to know what Mr. Long
would have to say about that. He represents a society of
enormously broad interests and one which has an active committee on research activities, and which is organized in sections
of specialists who are considering exactly this sort of thing---bibliographies and the needs of the different regions, the
different areas in his field.

MR. LONG: Our Society of Modern Language Literature
is organized into about fifty groups which deal with different literatures in different periods. The majority of
these have both a bibliographical committee and a research
activities committee. Most of them have one or the other,
and it is easy enough to bring those into being in the groups
which happen not to possess them at present. They can give us
information as to what the prominent scholars in their particular groups need, and the combined result of that would come
before our Association Committee of Research Activity which
passes upon propositions by these groups. The result is that
through that machinery we should be able to present without too <span style="page" id="page209">[p.209]</span> great delay---of course this is the summer vacation---a fairly
complete prospectus of the things that are urgently needed,
urgently wanted, by scholars in our limited fields.

The thing that disturbs me is this: I don't see
evidence that scholars themselves have yet become urgently
excited about this, because we have our own microfilm committee
the Photographic Reproduction Committee, and applications to
that can be made by interested scholars at any time. There
has been an increase, apparently, but not a very striking increase, and I was struck also by the fact that microfilm,
while it has run up to one thousand a month, still hasn't reached
the alarming proportions I should expect. That is, so far as
the urgent need for immediate material is concerned, the emergency doesn't seem to have affected scholars in ordering
through our agencies. They may, however, have been ordering
quite widely individually through agencies abroad.

MR. POST: May I make another remark in that connection. I think it is quite true that many scholars haven't
realized the importance of ordering microfilm, and on the
other hand, a great many who have realized it have done it
independently, as I have done in my own work; in fact, I have
taken a vast amount of it myself. But our problem is to interest scholars in ordering not for their own needs but in choosing <span style="page" id="page210">[p.210]</span> from their own fields materials that will represent most
adequately those in European libraries and archives and which
will be of future benefit in this country, not just for immediate needs.

MR. LONG: I can produce in the space of two weeks
a pretty complete list of the things needed in Spanish. <span style="page" id="page211">[p.211]</span>

MR. MCMANAWAY: Several of the points made this
morning have been of special interest to me. I say this morning because during the technical discussions of yesterday after
noon, as a representative of the Folger Library I sat and
listened, having nothing to contribute. We have continued
rather quietly to add to our collections of books and manuscripts on the Renaissance and have left it to other institutions to work out the problems of microphotography.
Occasionally we are called upon to supply books for reproduction, but
when the microfilm is needed, we usually invoke the assistance
of the Library of Congress. We have no microfilm equipment at
the present time and I don't know just when we shall have such
equipment.

Two or three of the things said this morning have
interested us. For instance, we discount heavily the need for
attempting to reproduce at once all of the titles listed in the
Short Title Catalogue. It is our belief that at Folger,
Huntington, Harvard and elsewhere, upwards of 90 per cent of
the titles are already available, and these can be reproduced
on call of the individual scholar at some future time as they
may be needed. That statement may come as somewhat of a surprise to a few of the members of the conference because few
people realize the extent of the Folger holdings in early <span style="page" id="page212">[p.212]</span> English books. According to Dr. Bliss of the Huntington (I
say this subject to correction) our collection is more extensive than the Huntington, which means we push Bodley rather
closely and they come just after the British Museum. So we are
not particularly interested in securing microfilms of English
books prior to 1640. If funds are available for emergency use
in Europe now, and if we are to accept the counsel of despair
and try to constitute America as the sole depository of the
records of civilization, what we at Folger should be interested
in is the reproduction in microfilm or photostat---we rather prefer photostats though they are more expensive---of such manuscript
collections as can be found at the Bodleian, such as the
Rawlinson poetical group, or the literary manuscripts from the
Horjeian collection, or the Sloane MSS or some of the others
at the British Museum. I believe these literary manuscripts
were hardly alluded to yesterday in most of the discussions,
most of the conferees being interested chiefly in archives.

We have very great interest in the archives, of
course, for biographical material and historical background, but
we should like to place special emphasis on the literary manuscripts, for instance, the Poetical Miscellanies of the sixteenth and seventeenth century which are such an excellent
guide to the taste of the time. These in a very few cases have <span style="page" id="page213">[p.213]</span> been reproduced, but ordinarily the scholar looks through a
miscellany to find the works of a single author and when he has
located those he closes the book and passes on, and the great
bulk of the miscellanies in the British Museum and elsewhere
are not available for scholarly use. We should like to see
those reproduced if there should be funds in almost unlimited
quantity for speech reproduction of rare materials.

Mr. Metcalf suggested one qualification of the plan
of reproducing books before 1640, namely, that in many libraries
it would be more economical to subscribe to such a project in
order to get microfilms for the use of readers than to make
microfilms of one's own books to supply readers when they come
and thus avoid wear and tear of the precious originals. That is
a serious consideration. We at Folger are proceeding slowly with
the reproduction of our rarest books, but we might conceivably
find it advisable to subscribe to a series of 1640 microfilms
just to spare the originals which are in our vaults.

One other thing is the paucity of Folger cards in the
Union Catalogue. As rapidly as our early English books are
catalogued, cards are deposited with the Union Catalogue, but
as most of you probably know, we haven't catalogued as many as
one-tenth, I should guess, of our pre-1640 English books.
Continental books are untouched; eighteenth century books are <span style="page" id="page214">[p.214]</span> untouched, and when a record of those can be made available
to scholars, we believe a great many of the gaps will have been
filled in. It is necessary to offer an apology, I suppose,
that we have not proceeded more rapidly, but with a small staff
a project of such a size does move slowly.

There are some twenty-odd American libraries that
receive our author cards as they are prepared, but in most
cases it is necessary for the scholar to write to us and find
out whether we have the S.T.C. item. One or two libraries have
sent copies of the S.T.C. to Folger so that our holdings might
be checked therein; perhaps in future other institutions will
find it profitable to do likewise. Meanwhile, if funds should
be made available, clerks might be set to transcribing our
records for immediate deposit in the Union Catalogue.

CO-CHAIRMAN LELAND: That gives us further illustration of how we will proceed in a specialized field such as
the period of Elizabethan studies.

MR. CASE: We have given some consideration at
Brown to microfilming the John Hay catalogue which has never
been published. That will be for our own domestic uses up
there, but it occurred to me that it would be worth asking
whether such a device as that would assist in the Union Catalogue, and whether if it were found, as we expect, that it
is a fairly speedy and not too expensive way of duplicating <span style="page" id="page215">[p.215]</span> library catalogues, submission of prints to the Library of
Congress would assist them or whether strip microfilm would be
too difficult to handle in speedily integrating catalogues of
many libraries into union list.

CO-CHAIRMAN LELAND: That is a technical question that
Mr. Schwegmann has doubtless considered. I will ask Mr.
Schwegmann to reply to that question by Mr. Case.

MR. SCHWEGMANN: I can give a specific example. We
have on 16 mm. film the card shelf lists---some 600,000---of
the various Washington libraries, mainly departmental libraries.
For two years I have been trying to have the WPA devote a
project to copying the film onto cards. I think the matter is
about concluded now and the cards will be copied. Of course
we can't do it here, we don't have the help and it will require
quite a lot of help to do it, so the only answer to that is
if we can find a WPA project, or once having started one we
hope to have started in a few weeks we can continue to feed
such things into that project, of course the result would be
very nice from our viewpoint and it would give us exactly
what we want.

CO-CHAIRMAN LELAND: The answer is you can incorporate
a strip film copy of a large catalog if you can process it into
the form of cards which can be integrated with your cards. <span style="page" id="page216">[p.216]</span> In other words, it can't be incorporated immediately, directly,
it has to be processed into the form of cards.

MR. SCHWEGMANN: That is right.

MR. TILLEUX: Mr. Chairman, I am quite interested in
what Mr. Schwegmann just said because quite a number of WPA
projects have for their objective the preparation of union
catalogues. By "union" I mean union within the city, or possibly within a small part of the state. From that, by pulling
together the small libraries within the certain locality we
hope eventually to build up state lists, and from those state
lists we can build up a national list. In doing that, we
either have to send personnel to the libraries to copy the
cards there, or we take pictures of the cards. The reason we are
turning more and more to filming the card catalogue is probably
obvious to you. Most libraries are under-staffed, they are overcrowded with books, most of their material isn't in the form
in which they would like to have it, and they just don't have
space for WPA workers to come in. We sometimes find librarians who frown when we mention coming in to assist with the
preparation of the union catalogue. They say, "I don't know
where I would put you," and so forth. When we tell them that
we only need a day or two, that we are going to bring a
Recordak machine in, pass those cards through the machine and <span style="page" id="page217">[p.217]</span> then get out of the way, that puts a different picture before
them. We film those cards, take the film to a central headquarters, usually a large fireproof warehouse where we can
get hundreds of WPA personnel busy at the job of transcription,
and the 16 mm. film is put through reading machines and typists
transcribe the material to those cards. Then those can be indexed and run together to make the comprehensive catalogue.

The next question that comes up before us is, who is
going to use this catalogue once it is prepared, and what is
to be done with it? We have had to educate a few librarians
who can't see that there is any necessity for this information
being made available to anyone else. They say, "Who cares
besides the people of our particular locality?" What we want
to know is, is this book available, and if so, at what library,
and we have to point out to them they may have resources which
other parts of the country would like to know about. Mr. Downs
was very modest a few moments ago when he referred to a publication by which he means his own "Resources of Southern Libraries"
which at least, as he said, points out the location of particular types of material. We want that stuff brought to publication just as his own findings were brought to publication, and
we tell them that publication may be one of a number of kinds.

It may be that they will have to prepare a short <span style="page" id="page218">[p.218]</span> title to the book and mimeograph that in rather large bulky
volumes---they come out about the size of a Washington telephone
directory, sometimes two or three in a series---and then mimeograph them in sufficient quantities to let every library in
that area have a copy, and then send at least four copies to
the Washington office of WPA. Those are then distributed to
the Library of Congress, the National Archives and other
libraries to which scholars are immediately referred if they
need assistance.

Another type of publication which we have been recommending to take the place of the very costly mimeographing of
all this material is the shipping to the Union Catalogue
Section of the Library of Congress of the trays containing the
cards. I was particularly interested in what Mr. Milam said
earlier this morning about the inadequacy of the Union Catalogue
here, and I don't know exactly where the responsibility must
be placed. We have a thousand things to think of, and particularly personnel and space. My understanding---and I may be
wrong about it---is that the reason we don't have the complete
Philadelphia union catalogue in the Library of Congress is
that they have never been able to supply either the space or
personnel, or possibly both, to complete the work. The last I
heard about it was that they had done some trays but they <span style="page" id="page219">[p.219]</span> had had to tell them to hold off a little while until they got
more room or more people.

In the City of Chicago the Chicago Public Library
is sponsoring an omnibus project of many phases, but Phase "A"
is the extension of library service, including the preparation
of bibliographies and union catalogues and check lists. I
have on my desk right now a union catalogue of books in the
field of art. They have proposed and temporarily withdrawn a
union catalogue of books in theology and church history. We require that such catalogues be made available to Mr. Schwegmann
and his staff so that they can go through the trays and check
their own holdings card by card and in that way build up their
complete file, but we can't send them in until they have the
staff to take care of them. Just exactly how that can be
accomplished, I don't know; whether WPA personnel can be placed
at such a task or the exact machinery by which that can be devised, I don't know, but there is that possibility.

Some have taken one side of the question of whether
or not we should do the European archives now or the South
American archives now. Dr. Bemis says no, you can't do it.
Dr. Kellar says it must be done and done immediately. Others
have mentioned long-range planning as against emergency
planning. But before we give up the idea that these union <span style="page" id="page220">[p.220]</span> catalogues must still be prepared, I would have you know that
in some instances the material is available if it could be
worked into the available cards.

CO-CHAIRMAN LELAND: That illustrates the need we
labor under of knowing a great deal more about what the
possibilities are, what is actually being done or has been
done, and brings us up, it seems to me, to the latter part
of Section IV, which is the necessity of coordination of the
work of selection, and how can this coordination be assured.
We have had, I think, sufficient illustration of the possibilities of the Union Catalogue, its defects, its advantages, its
processes, its methods, and so forth, and we have had several
interesting illustrations of how want lists can be compiled
either by institutions such as the Folger Library, or by groups
of scholars such as the Renaissance group of the Huntington
library, or by organized groups within learned societies such as
those of the Modern Language Association. Of course we could
multiply illustrations of that sort but I don't think it would
be useful to do so because we would probably be plowing over
the same ground.

Obviously it is very nice to hear about these enterprises, these undertakings, these possibilities, but how to
cash in on this information that we are getting; I don't like <span style="page" id="page221">[p.221]</span> to use the word "coordination" but there is hardly a better
word; how to assure that this work is utilized, that these
possibilities are realized, that where selections are not being
made people can be stimulated to make the selections, is the
problem before us. The machinery exists in the form of the
councils, the National Research Council, the Social Science
Research Council and the Council of Learned Societies, and
their constituent societies. All those different kinds of
machinery I think can be made to work more or less in harmony
with each other. But what should be the central body which
would assume the responsibility for stimulating, for gathering
information, for making it available, for formulating a program and for directing the execution of the program? That I
think is the problem that we have got to consider a good deal
during the rest of this conference.

The question is now to consider it with especial
reference to the problem of the selection of materials, the
preparation of want lists. Is that a function that could be
assumed by this Continuation Committee when it becomes established, when it becomes fully organized, when it has surrounded
itself with the necessary sub-committees? A committee of course
can't operate without machinery. The best machinery is probably
provided by institutions, institutions which function and <span style="page" id="page222">[p.222]</span> exist, like the Library of Congress, like the New York Public,
like other libraries. What are your views with regard to the
agency of coordination and of direction and of planning for
this work of selection?

MR. BEMIS: Mr. Chairman, I should like to say a word
on that point. I have been a little dismayed by the variegated
character of our discussions and the use of the word "emergency"
and the wants which so many people have and the vast fields in
which those wants are wanted. I think, indeed, this Continuation Committee might be made a proper medium to focus a definite
program, and with due diffidence I suggest that it might be
hoped that the Library of Congress would employ the advice of
such a Continuation Committee for the inauguration of as simple
as possible a plan for photo-reproduction of materials: (1)
books and (2) manuscripts. But so far as any great program of
salvaging the documentary records of European culture from
Europe now is concerned, I feel very strongly we just crossed
that off. It is futile and Pickwickian to talk about it.

One may simplify the process of selection to fit
onto the work which has been done by established institutions
of research, and I should very strongly urge that it be restricted to those institutions, to those fields of research
which are most identified with the history of our nation, and <span style="page" id="page223">[p.223]</span> let the other fields be covered individually by the different
societies which have already been created to cultivate them.
I very much feel we will get into an impossible thicket of
source materials and a plethora of wants and an impractical
program if we try to extend it too much.

I fear what I have said isn't awfully clear. I am
confused by the vast panorama of testimonies and wants, the
eagerness of people to conjure up those vistas on the one hand
and the meagerness of actual work by scholars in the vistas
upon the other hand. I think if we stick to something simple
and relatively economical, we are likely to accomplish something, but there isn't unlimited sums of money at our disposal
to bring together all the source materials of European culture,
and even if there were, it is impossible to do it now. It
might be impossible anyway, even if there were no war. I
think it is idle to talk about it. The most we can simplify
our program and make it economical and supplement that by long-term plans, the more real actual results I would hope to get
from it.

MR. POST: At the risk of being a member of the
"Fifth Column" I want to defend our laying the foundations
right now for a plan to photograph materials in Europe. Not
one of us interested in materials in Europe has dreamed of

## p. 224 (#459) ############################################

photographing all of them. We have urged---Professor Lunt and
I did last night---the necessity of choosing carefully, selecting the materials that are now obtainable in European libraries
and archives, and I have emphasized books as well as documents
in order to bring them over here. As for the war in Europe,
some people believe---and here again perhaps I am a "Fifth
Columnist"---that the war may be over by the end of this year.
It is true that doesn't mean that permanent peace will settle
down on Europe, at least, but at least another truce in this
century's One Hundred Years War may come after the end of
this year, and it certainly will do no harm to have the various
committees, learned societies or whatever you choose, be planning to photograph that material, shall we say next year, or at
the very moment when conditions are such that they can in
Europe. We have to do it in the truce that follows this war
in order to have the material before the next war begins.

MR. POWER: I think perhaps I can give a little
information on that point. We are still and continually photographing materials in Cambridge, the British Museum and
Bodleian, and I have on the way over 1,000 feet of negative
from three libraries; I have received word it has been shipped
and it is somewhere either in customs or on the way. I know
the Bodleian, for example, is willing to unpack some of the <span style="page" id="page225">[p.225]</span> things they have put away and to photograph them. That is not
necessarily any great inconvenience to them because I have
stressed in my correspondence with them the necessity of not
going to that inconvenience in view of the unsettled times
and the under-staffed conditions. However, they are willing
to, and very often the classifications which they have made
up to evacuate in successive order, Classes A, B, and C, in
view of the emergency, contain the very things you want and
oftentimes I think would be easier to get then they might be
under normal conditions.

CO-CHAIRMAN LELAND: I think it is quite time we
heard from someone who represents more particularly the needs
of scientists. We have been discussing the needs of historians
and scholars of literature this morning.

MR. WATSON DAVIS: That is the point I wish to speak
to. It seems to me that one of the things we most urgently
need are the scientific materials from Europe which may not
be getting through to this country. Fortunately, in general
the flow of scientific literature has been pretty well sustained one way or another, but there is the possibility of
obtaining, if it is necessary to do so, through diplomatic
pouch or otherwise, single copies of journals that do not other
wise get through and reproducing them in microfilm form for the <span style="page" id="page226">[p.226]</span> use of those research workers in industry and government
laboratories and elsewhere who do urgently need that information. It seems to me from the standpoint of need and usage,
from the standpoint of our national defense program, from the
standpoint of scientific advancement generally, we have got
to have that continued flow of scientific information.

One of the most useful fields for large-scale copying---I don't think we know how large that field is---would be the
obtaining of long runs of serials which are not held adequately,
foreign scientific journals which are not held adequately in
this country. It seems to me that is something that in the
American Documentation Institute activities does come up from
time to time. It is extremely important, it seems to me, to
have access to whatever scientific men and women are producing
in whatever part of the world, and in whatever language.

I would like to mention also the practical possibility
of bringing to the scholar at his desk, or to the scientist at
his desk, the information, the actual materials held in American depositories, through cooperation of microfilming agencies.
The completion of the Union Catalogue certainly is a major
desire for all of us. The Union Catalogue, as I understand it,
extends only to those pieces of printed matter which have been
given the honor of a binding; in other words, books. As a <span style="page" id="page227">[p.227]</span> matter of fact, in scientific work it is often the journal
article which is most important. The extension of the Union
Catalogue to include all periodical literature is perhaps almost
an unthinkable suggestion, and yet I do feel that with a
country as rich as we are, we have got some day to come to what
amounts to a union catalogue or a listing of all of our periodical literature, all of our books, in order that the scientist
and scholars of the country may have at their disposal in
essentially one place all of the information about the past researches in any one field.

In the meantime, until that is achieved, we can achieve
somewhat the same sort of service if we can have our microfilming agencies in each one of the libraries freely and with
cordial relations transfer orders from library to library without further reference to the person who wants the material, if
you want to fix it so that the research worker, once he asks for
something that is in a library, will get it regardless of what
library it is in. I think the major thing we have got to do in
this whole essential aid to scholarship and scientific research
is to give the scientific and scholarly material to the person
who actually uses it when he wants it, as fast as we can, without essential reference to where it happens to be held.

CO-CHAIRMAN LELAND: That of course involves the <span style="page" id="page228">[p.228]</span> possible organization of a very elaborate domestic service,
doesn't it?

MR. DAVIS: The organization of a domestic service,
but I don't believe it would be elaborate.
I think it would be
extremely simple and it involves, as I see it, only three
things: cooperation between the microfilming agencies, a relatively uniform order blank which would correspond to the order
card that a library uses, and a relatively standard price for
microfilming.

MR. EVANS: I would just like to suggest the laying of
one problem in the laps of the Continuation Committee. The WPA
would welcome, I believe, a carefully considered recommendation
from the Continuation Committee as to how the clerical labor resources of the WPA could be brought to bear to assist in the
execution of a large-scale program of filling the gaps in the
Union Catalogue from American holdings. Mr. Schwegmann has mentioned the microfilming of 600,000 cards representing the holdings of libraries of the District of Columbia which we did on
the project here in Washington of the Historical Records Survey
several years ago. That work went incomplete because of the
fact that the program for the transcription of that microfilm
onto cards and the filing of that in the Union Catalogue was not
carried out. A national program was required in that case and <span style="page" id="page229">[p.229]</span> was not forthcoming because the labor resources of the WPA in
the District of Columbia were not adequate to handle that job.
There is a serious shortage of typists; the government departments gobble them up as fast as we can train them and we have
to go elsewhere in order to have that typing work done.

There is a particular problem which I think could be
solved through the WPA, and that is the hand transcription
of all of the cards in the forty or fifty major libraries that
have been mentioned which represent foreign titles. That is
a perfectly feasible undertaking.
It is extremely costly
in labor resources, but labor resources are the cheapest thing
in the country so far as WPA is concerned, and we know it could
be done, and done easily, even if it ran to ten million titles.
We have in the Chicago office of the Historical Records Survey
now, I don't know exactly how many millions, perhaps five
millions of slips; most of them are typed, representing holdings of American libraries, but that covers only American imprints. To do a similar job in the field of foreign titles
would be just about as feasible. There would be more errors
in your cards because the WPA workers are not uniformly
capable of handling foreign languages, even in transcribing
them with perfect results.

I merely mention those two things to illustrate the <span style="page" id="page230">[p.230]</span> point that WPA can help in turning many of these corners if it
is presented with a well thought-out program.

MR. BUCK: The section of our agenda that we are
discussing now seems to me to be concerned with a determination
of what we would like to add to the resources for research that
are available in this country, and I should like to submit that
regardless of whether or not it is the right time to begin a
comprehensive microfilming project of such materials in Europe,
a point on which I differ with Dr. Bemis, it would be very well
worth while for us to ascertain what our needs are as comprehensively as possible, and particularly to ascertain that now.
I think the experiences of the past in connection with great
wars, and upheavals that frequently follow wars, indicate that
either during the war or after the war, many European private
libraries and collections of books and manuscripts are likely
to come on the market and become available for acquisition, and
while I understand that this conference is primarily concerned
with the microcopying of research materials, it would certainly
be greatly advantageous to the research interests of this
country if when it appears that much material available in
Europe can be acquired, not in microcopies but in books and
pamphlets, and even in original manuscripts in many cases, we
are prepared with inventories of our needs and know what we <span style="page" id="page231">[p.231]</span> want to get.

MR. MacLEISH: I should like most earnestly to underline what Mr. Buck has said. It seems to me that is the heart
of the whole problem.
After all, one can go around from the
hen to the egg indefinitely, but I think that is the place to
start. I am impressed by what Mr. Bemis says. I also disagree
with him, and disagree with him both rationally and emotionally
but nevertheless I think there is a very considerable amount in
what he says. I think we have lost the moment. There was a
time when perhaps we could have sent crews to Europe on a vast
scale envisaged by Bob Binkley and brought something back but
that time has probably gone by. At the same time, even taking
the case as he presents it, it seems to me that there is a
great deal to be said for the initiation of a program now which
would make it possible to take advantage of opportunities as
they open themselves, and I should say the basis of that could
be, first of all, the establishment of a center which would
receive want lists, which would build up lists of things desired, plus the putting into effect of a mechanism which would
draw such lists from scholars in this country.

The Library of Congress has recently had an experience which states dramatically what all of you know, which is
that no two specialists in any field will agree about anything. <span style="page" id="page232">[p.232]</span> We have been trying to prepare for the State Department a list
of books to be offered to Latin American countries under the
Buenos Aires Convention of 1936. In order to expedite the work,
or so we thought, we prepared tentative lists in the various
fields and we submitted these to experts, five or six in each
area, and received letters which---well, which were very
interesting. I don't believe that we are going to get a list
out of it. I think we are simply going to have to send the
total list down to the State Department and ask them to throw
dice.

Nevertheless, it is conceivable that the learned
societies, knowing as they do those scholars who have particular interests in particular fields, might say to those various
scholars that perhaps they would assume the responsibility of
establishing a list back of which each individual scholar would
stand and the putting of those together at some central point
would give at least a basis for action, and if that central
point were manned to such an extent that it was a true way,
center for the forwarding of requests, as Mr. Davis has suggested, if it were adequately manned for that purpose I think
at least you would have an agency with which to begin. I
can't help but feel that is the way to begin, and as I said
before, although no one feels more strongly than I the <span style="page" id="page233">[p.233]</span> desirability of building up the Union Catalogue---I know I
feel it very strongly and want to do everything I can to do it---nevertheless that is in the future and it is a problem. We
presented that case as well as I knew how to present it to the
Appropriations Committee, and the one unit in the library as
to which we were unable to get any advance whatsoever was the
Union Catalogue because that does not appeal. If we are going
to get money out of Congress to build up the Union Catalogue,
I suggest perhaps there ought to be a body of scholarly
opinion---I don't want to violate the Hatch Bill---made known
to Congressional committees, and perhaps it might also be
possible, in view of the fact that the establishment of the
Union Catalogue here would be of very great interest and very
great importance to scholars, universities, colleges, libraries
throughout the country, to establish some sort of reciprocal
operation by which we got a little help.

CO-CHAIRMAN LELAND: I think that puts the point very
clearly and we reach the point now at the close of this discussion where I think everybody is agreed that if these various
plans can be realized, if the various needs are to be met, it
has got to be done by some agency which is capable of instituting the deliberations that are necessary, receiving the results
of those deliberations, acting upon them, and developing a <span style="page" id="page234">[p.234]</span> program of putting them into operation.
That I think is to be
one of the principal jobs of the Continuation Committee, to
consider how such an agency can be established and where it
should be established. If there are any opinions as to that,
I shall be glad to hear them. Otherwise, I will ask my colleague
in the chairmanship to assume charge of the proceedings and we
will proceed to V and VI, which after all are closely related
to this; I mean they go right on from this problem as presented
by Mr. MacLeish---the problems of the organization, direction
and support of the copying operations, and the receipt, storage
and servicing of materials---because after all this does assume
there is some sort of an agency for doing all these things
and this is trying to indicate some of the functions of that
agency. With your permission, then, we will conclude this discussion of Section IV and devote the rest of the time, about
an hour and a half that remains to us, to the consideration of
V and VI, although I suspect some of the things that weren't
said under No. IV will be coming up under the discussion of
V and VI.

CO-CHAIRMAN LYDENBERG: The lead-up to this has been
so beautiful that I think there is nothing more to do than to
ask what your opinion is as to the question before us. We
assume---I am sure it needs no demonstration---that there is a <span style="page" id="page235">[p.235]</span> necessity for some organization and direction, and likewise
support, of these efforts. What is the obvious location for
that organization, and the obvious form of the organization?

MR. MacLEISH: I am willing to stick my neck out. I
suggest the form of the organization might very well be---and I
am using powder that was put in my pocket a little while ago---a combination of Bibliofilm and the Union Catalogue, using such
funds as are available outside the Library of Congress, such
funds as can be found inside the Library of Congress---and as
to that I am not very sanguine---to build up in connection with
our present incomplete Union Catalogue the necessary central
agency. I don't mean to say that I ask for that. I suggest
that that is a possible mechanism.

CO-CHAIRMAN LYDENBERG: In a way it is forced on you.
As a matter of fact, it has the advantage of two continuing
organizations with healthy records behind them. Can we develop
team play, and granting that, how can we assure its support?

MR. TILLEUX: Mr. Chairman, Luther Evans a moment ago
blurted out what I had been trying to hint at, namely, that the
Works Projects Administration might be used as a device for
achieving some of the objectives you have in mind. The reason
I didn't say so is because WPA is not supposed to make suggestions to you; you people are supposed to make suggestions to <span style="page" id="page236">[p.236]</span> it. We don't go out and drum up projects.
If you want something
done you get a public sponsor, call in the state administrator
or one of his assistants, tell him what you want done, he helps
you draw up a form stating the number of personnel of each
sex, and particular work classifications needed to perform the
job, and then it is sent in to Washington and on the basis of a
lot of things it is either approved, disapproved or recommended
for change, alteration of scope or plan.

Some of those things are such obvious matters as,
Are the personnel who can do the work actually available on relief rolls? Is the person who is going to supervise the work
actually qualified to do a good job? Those are just two. There
are dozens of others, such, for example, as, Will the sponsor
maintain the work after we set it up?

I might say in passing that a lot of sponsors have
been surprised when they have come into Washington to talk to
us at finding that far from being upset by large schemes,
we are inspired by them. They must be sound, but the job of
supplying one hundred or one thousand or one million workers
doesn't particularly "faze" us. You may not be altogether satisfied with the result. I have gone through card files, index
slips prepared by WPA workers, and one drawer will be very much
better than another drawer, which shows that the supervision <span style="page" id="page237">[p.237]</span> has not been adequate at that particular stage. It might be that
after those cards were checked by me, they were checked by
someone else and those errors found, but we are not trying to
set up perfection right now, but rather a type of progressive
advance in American scholarship.

If you have a scheme whereby clerical work can be
done, that is, the ground-breaking, or what Mr. Binkley called the
factory or mass-production type of work in American scholarship,
then I think your Continuation Committee should keep in mind
that federal funds might very well, very profitably, very
wisely for the sake of the American people, be expended in that
way, because utility, the actual use to which the material will
be put, is one of the things that we considered in judging
the advisability of a project application.

MR. WATSON DAVIS: Mr. Chairman, it seems to me the
suggestion Mr. MacLeish has made is the happiest idea I have
heard since the organization of the American Documentation
Institute. It seems to me that it does provide a powerful
mechanism for advancing scholarship in scientific research.

MR. BUCK: Mr. Chairman, I wonder if it wouldn't be
desirable for Mr. Davis to explain a little more the organization and set-up of the American Documentation Institute. I
think most people understand Bibliofilm Service and how it <span style="page" id="page238">[p.238]</span> operates, but the charter of the Documentation Institute is a
very much broader thing than Bibliofilm Service and I question
whether many of those here understand the real nature of the
Documentation Institute as it was set up under its original
charter.

MR. DAVIS: The American Documentation Institute is
a non-profit organization under the laws of Delaware following,
I believe, the pattern of some of the agencies of the government
formed in recent years. Its membership is made up of nominations from approximately sixty agencies, and I think it is rather
unique in the fact that it brings into one organization representatives from the scholarly fields, the social sciences, the
physical and natural sciences, government agencies and library
agencies. Its powers under its Articles of Incorporation are
very broad. In fact, I think it can do anything the scholars
and scientists of this country want done, and I feel I interpret
the wishes of the Board and the membership in saying that it
should do and will do anything that the scholars and scientists
want done.

Its activities consist in part in the operation 
of Bibliofilm Service which is a microfilming agency serving
four, and more, government libraries. One reason it is doing
that actual microfilming operation is historical; another <span style="page" id="page239">[p.239]</span> reason is that some of the government departments  due to the
laws of the government find it difficult to operate and defray
the expenses of operation of microfilming activities in their
own libraries. In that sense, it is in those libraries serving
those libraries by invitation on behalf of the scholars and
scientists.

There is another aspect to Bibliofilm Service as an
operation. The American Documentation Service has served as
a quiet, unassuming testing ground for this very moot question
of copyright. There are a few other important activities of
the American Documentation Institute, one of which is the
auxiliary publication service which I believe has very large
possibilities in putting at the disposal of scholars and
scientists research material which under other circumstances
cannot be distributed. Very briefly, the way this service
operates is this: The individual who has a research paper to
get into the record and get to his fellow workers goes to the
editor of a journal. The editor of the journal says, "I can
print a short article"---or an article as long as the editor
wishes to print. The editor will also print a note in connection with that article stating that the full paper---it may be
thousands of pages long---can be obtained by sending a stated
amount to the American Documentation Institute, who will then <span style="page" id="page240">[p.240]</span> in response to that order reproduce from the original paper
deposited with the American Documentation Institute the document
in microfilm form and make it available to the worker. In
that way we have effective distribution, effective publication
of material, without the cost of large edition printing.

Obviously, that original file of manuscripts is very
valuable and it must be protected and should be protected. I
believe we can cut down to a very large extent the cost of publication if we utilize that method which has been proved
successful, and utilize it more effectively.

There are other activities in which the American
Documentation Institute has engaged from time to time as the
need seems to have arisen. There are other activities which
it can do if organizations of scholars and research workers
want them done.

MR. MILAM: Mr. Chairman, I would like to express the
hope that the Continuation Committee will bear in mind the
unsurpassed standing of the American Council of Learned
Societies with the scholars and scholarly institutions of this
country. A very considerable part of the job for the first
few years will apparently be in relations with the constituent
organizations and others of the American Council, and I should
like, therefore, to reiterate and to express the hope that the <span style="page" id="page241">[p.241]</span> Continuation Committee will find some way to involve the
Council permanently in the set-up that may be established.

CO-CHAIRMAN LELAND: The Council gets very easily
involved. I think the S.S.R.C. is also interested, and we
have a representative in the form of Mr. Nichols. I wish he
would say something from that point of view.

MR. NICHOLS: Dr. Leland, as you know, the Social
Science Research Council has been cooperating in the Joint
Committee and gave its hearty support to Mr. Binkley's activities, and it has recently expanded its own work in that line
through the appointment of a Committee on the Control of
Social Science Data. Naturally our interests are very much
bound up with yours in the American Council, and if the way
seems open, I am sure we will be glad to cooperate in any of
these long-range plans. If you invite our cooperation I am
sure you will receive it.

MR. MILAM: Mr. Chairman, I forgot to say the Council
also has an unsurpassed standing, I am told, with the
foundations. (Laughter)

CO-CHAIRMAN LELAND: That is a notion which is not
only exaggerated but dangerous.

CO-CHAIRMAN LYDENBERG: Mr. MacLeish, do you think it
would be possible to ask the Librarian of Congress if he would <span style="page" id="page242">[p.242]</span> receive a hypothetical question put before him as the result of
the discussion today, namely, whether he felt that the
Library of Congress would be in a position, would welcome the
opportunity of assuming the responsibility for the organization
direction, of a joint effort of the Documentation Institute and
the various councils in an effort to coordinate these copying
projects? Is there any way you feel that such a hypothetical
question might be considered now for future translation from
hypothesis to the direct form?

MR. MacLEISH: Mr. Chairman, I could take the
Librarian of Congress off in a corner; but I can give a straight
answer to the substance of your inquiry. The Librarian of
Congress would be very proud indeed to be of this kind of service. This seems to me to be precisely the kind of service
the Library of Congress ought to give. I think of the Library
as a group of people attempting to do this sort of thing with
the aid of their collections, rather than a collection of books
served by people. This is what we would like to do. Now the
practical question is, of course, the question of money to
which Mr. Milam has so delicately adverted. I hope he is right
and I sincerely hope that that channel will be kept open and we
will be able to retreat along it.

There is, of course, the question of whether WPA <span style="page" id="page243">[p.243]</span> funds might not be made available in some manner not only to
build up the Union Catalogue but also to undertake this kind of
work. As perhaps some of you gentlemen know, a project has
been suggested to the WPA for the photographing of American
newspapers. That project which has the active interest of the
WPA runs into the difficulty that the material charge is excessive in relation to the cost of service. That seems to be a
very real difficulty and one with which we will have to
wrestle, and the same difficulty would arise here. So I
should not be very hopeful of getting WPA aid. How far we can
get foundation aid is of course a question as to which many of
you have better ideas than my own.

There remains the fundamental question as to how
far the appropriations for the Library of Congress would enable
us to do this kind of thing, and I am quite willing to state my
conviction that it ought to be large enough for that purpose.
I am also perfectly frank to state my own conviction that it 
won't be if it depends simply upon our presentation of the case.
In a matter of this kind we would be speaking for American
scholarship and we ought to be able to speak for American
scholarship with some assurance that our speaking would be
backed up. That, however, is for the future. That looks toward fiscal '42 which begins a year from next July 1 and isn't <span style="page" id="page244">[p.244]</span> very helpful now. We will do whatever we can do within the
limits of our appropriation and within the limits of aid that
can be secured to carry on this kind of service if this is the
kind of service American scholars want us to carry on.

CO-CHAIRMAN LYDENBERG: Thank you. I am sure it is
the kind of service that American scholars want done, and I
should say that it puts emphatically up to us the responsibility
for assuring the Library of Congress not only of our applause
for the willingness, but of our support for the material.

As a matter of fact, I should say that we have come
so quickly over Nos. 13, 14 and 15 that we find a fairly
satisfactory answer to 13 and 15. To be sure, we have not
determined as to the sources from which special support can
be secured. We are open to suggestions of novel and untapped
resources to appeal to.

CO-CHAIRMAN LELAND: I think, Mr. Chairman, that
emphasis should be given to the question immediately preceding
that: From what sources may special support be secured? If
the results of these operations are worth a great deal to
scholarship, to individual scholars,to scholars collectively,
to libraries, and so forth, it seems to me that some degree of
self-support should be assured for them. Whether that is
feasible or not, I am sure I don't know, but I think that <span style="page" id="page245">[p.245]</span> those possibilities ought to be as fully explored as possible,
because my experience with our more usual sources of support,
at least the sources to which we more usually apply for support,
is that the Lord helps those who help themselves; at least He
likes to do it better, He does it with more pleasure, and it
seems to me that some degree of self-support ought to be expected
here in services that are going to be so generally useful.

CO-CHAIRMAN LYDENBERG: Mr. Power has demonstrated
that certain efforts to this end are self-supporting. Dr.
Bishop has pointed out that the opportunities are overwhelming.
I should think that the ordinary administrator of any library
or of any institution would say that that is nowhere different
from the problems of yesterday and tomorrow.

MR. TATE: Mr. Chairman, I would like to speak a
moment to that particular point. At the present time we have
been talking rather much today and yesterday of microphotography
as an agent in servicing scholarly material. It might be of
value to examine the actual situation. To date most of the
impact of microphotography has been on libraries, and in the
secondary sense on a limited number of individual scholars. As
the result, most of the large projects that have been carried
out are library projects, inter-library loan, newspaper, the
gathering of rare books, etc. It seems to me that there must <span style="page" id="page246">[p.246]</span> be, if this program is to grow, become what it should become,
more emphasis placed on microphotography for the individual
scholar. The microfilm is a device of expediency and if the
person who is actually the ultimate consumer, who is actually
to use microphotography, is not acquainted with it, is not acquainted with its possibilities and has not the instruments
in his possession to use it, then we are I think defeating
our main purpose to a certain extent. Some efforts are being
made to provide the ultimate consumer with the instruments
for the use of microfilm. A great many more efforts should
be made to educate individual scholars in the use of microfilm.
As a matter of fact, it has been said that a graduate student
isn't worth very much until he has been out about five years.
Microphotography in scholarship is about ten years old. We have
only a limited crop of young graduate students who know microphotography and use it. With all due respect, the older scholars have become conditioned to certain operating technics and
they adopt microphotography rather slowly except in certain
outstanding exceptions.

It seems to me that a certain proportion of the
activity of the Continuation Committee could very logically be
devoted directly to educational work and to the incorporation
of microphotography in the courses, let us say, of research <span style="page" id="page247">[p.247]</span> training which are offered to graduate students. They generally
receive some instruction in bibliography, in the other
"ographies," and in the use of the library. They should receive, too, precise instruction on the use of microphotography
in scholarship.

Then let us examine the situation. If the pressure
on librarians comes both from the front and the rear, I think
that librarians will be more interested in diverting as many
funds as they can lay their hands on to microphotography in
general, and also an individual scholar may be able to tap
foundation grants, grants-in-aid, even private funds---I speak
from experience---to the purchase of microfilm copies, and indirectly to the support of a program such as that which we have
in hand.

MR. DANTON: Mr. Chairman, might we not extend Dr.
Tate's remarks and give almost a categorical affirmative answer
to the second question under 15: Can they be made self-supporting, at least in part? Mr. Power has been able to
persuade fifteen or twenty libraries each to subscribe $500 a
year for four years for a limited group of materials, and I
should think that one of two things might easily be possible,
either that a fairly large group of forty or fifty research and
scholarly libraries might be persuaded to support by an annual <span style="page" id="page248">[p.248]</span> subscription such a program as we have generally considered
here, or that that support might come in another direction by
offering the libraries the opportunity of purchasing copies of
the materials that were more or less directly in their
spheres of interest.

MR. ROOSEN-RUNGE: I very heartily agree with Dr.
Tate on the question of the support of the needs of the individual scholar. I want to illustrate that point with one experience that we have had. We have filmed 2,100 articles for the
mathematical reviews, mathematical articles out of some of
the best known journals and also of a great many entirely unknown journals that are probably unique in this country---Russian, Rumanian, Indian, and so on. Out of this great
number of 2,100 articles, I think there have been ordered about
twenty since December 7, and of those twenty, I think probably
eight have been ordered for experimental purposes by people
who wanted to see what the things looked like. So you see how
extremely important it would be to educate the individuals.
There may be special reasons for this flop in this particular
case, but anyway it indicates the education would be just as
necessary.

MR. SCHWEGMANN: Mr. Chairman, in his opening remarks
yesterday Mr. MacLeish specifically asked that we consider <span style="page" id="page249">[p.249]</span> to some extent the matter of commercial competition or the
activity of library reproductions of microfilms and other
photoduplicates with commercial enterprises. But before bringing that question to the front, I think we should have a rather
frank discussion of the self-supporting theory that we are
adverting to now, or somewhat self-supporting in the reproduction of certain materials.

The illustration just brought out is typical or not,
I don't know, but we must to a large extent depend upon self-support or self-perpetuation of any of the programs, particularly a newspaper filming program. The philosophy of the photoduplication service of the Library of Congress is based 100 per
cent on Mr. Leland's dictum that God helps those who help themselves.
With that theory, we have been able to keep our
heads above water and to that extent I suppose it will be
termed as a successful undertaking from a financial viewpoint.
If we consider the policies and the philosophies of the various
duplicating services in the country today, we will all agree
the philosophy of operation in the Library of Congress, the
New York Public, the University of Chicago, perhaps many
others, is not so much non-profit as non-money losing.

I think it is essential that we bring this out at this
time because we not only must keep our heads above water and

## p. 250 (#511) ############################################

take in as much as we expend, but if we are to be self-supporting we must find a market, if you will, for positive or for
negatives that we have made, which will in turn through some
revolving fund system produce revenue for the production of
other depositors of new material. I don't think we can go to
the foundations or to any particular source year after year
and say, "We need thus and so for the reproduction of this and
that type of material." I think we should incorporate into our
thoughts a little cold business right now.

That brings up the question that Mr. MacLeish referred
to, that is, what would be the feeling of this meeting regarding the matter of possible conflict in interest between the
operations of library activities and commercial activities?

DR. MAYER: Mr. Chairman, I am authorized to say
in the name of the Army Medical Library that whatever microfilming in the field of medicine is done, we would purchase,
so that if ever a central institute could be established and
they would send out microfilming expeditions to some country
and they would find medical manuscripts or unique medical
books, then we would buy the negatives, and that probably would
solve the problem for the whole field of medicine because the
interests of the individual medical research man are the
same as the interests of the National Medical Library. <span style="page" id="page251">[p.251]</span>

MR. SEIDELL: I would like to speak a little of
Bibliofilm Service. Bibliofilm Service is operating in a
library which is conducted for the support of research in subjects pertaining to agriculture.
This library has gathered
together material that is used directly by the research people,
and in the many years that it has existed, I feel sure that
more complete service has been developed there than any other
library that I have ever seen anywhere. In other words, the
worker in the Department of Agriculture only has to ask for
as many books as he wishes, he can keep them as long as he
pleases. It is for the benefit of the employees and the money
that is spent by the Department is largely spent for the service of the men who can use the material in the library.

When Bibliofilm Service was begun there through the
consent of Miss Barnett, and with her approval and interest,
it was for the purpose of improving, we might say, the service
that such a library renders. When a book is loaned to a
person it contains many things of interest to others; I am
speaking now of periodicals in which original scientific research is published. Each periodical is made up of a heterogeneous number of papers, but when one man is using that
book it is no longer available to the other one, and the reproach that Bibliofilm Service has at the present time is the <span style="page" id="page252">[p.252]</span> slowness of the service we render because when a group of orders
are received, we can fill only 80 per cent of them. There are
20 per cent of the books that are out on loan.

I feel that in discussing this possibly my object
is a little different from the objects and aims of most of the
people here who are trying to collect and bring together rare
material to be used by scholars, whereas the purpose of
Bibliofilm Service since its inauguration has been simply to
serve the material in the Library of the Department of Agriculture to the research men who could use it. Originally it was
established to serve those outside the Department because
those inside the Department are able to borrow all they please,
they have perfect service, and we have never yet made any
effort to serve people within the Department of Agriculture.
A situation, though, has arisen in recent years which will make
it possible for Bibliofilm Service to become intimately useful
and very necessary for the Department of Agriculture itself,
because a million dollars has been appropriated to establish
in each of the four sections of the country a great research
laboratory. Now Bibliofilm Service can cooperate in furnishing
literature to those people which would have to be purchased
and libraries started in each special case, so there will arise
a greater and greater actual application or use of Bibliofilm <span style="page" id="page253">[p.253]</span> Service in the government service itself. I like to look upon
this microfilm copying as simply a perfection of library
service which should be rendered in exactly the same way that
all other library service is rendered. For instance, public
funds are appropriated to hire the people who operate the library. In the case of the Department of Agriculture, a very large
part of their time is spent in serving these books to the people
who use them. Under the present system, when a book is served
in that way it can't be used by someone else.
Therefore, microfilm furnishes a perfection in the service that the library itself can render. I believe that in time it will be found that
furnishing a microfilm copy of an individual article in
periodical will cost less than to lend that book, and it will
certainly be a very great advantage to the man who gets the
film. He can keep it; he can use it as long as he pleases.
When he borrows the book, it is necessary for him to send it
back after a short time.

I simply want to call attention to the fact that we
might try to look forward to the time that Bibliofilm Service
or Microfilm Service should not be considered as something
outside the libraries; it should be considered as simply
perfection of service which a library should eventually render
to those who can use their talents to promote the welfare of <span style="page" id="page254">[p.254]</span> man.

MR. PETTITT: Following up the remarks made by Mr.
Seidell, why could we not attempt to establish a loan service
on your Bibliofilm the same as you have on books? I am thinking now of developing the use of microfilms. Several people
have mentioned that the country must be educated to the usage
of this new medium, and one of the things which holds down the
use of it, I am sure, or would hold down the use of it, is
the cost, even though it is small. I recall in the last few
years I have had the task of trying to locate several books
in the country which were rather rare, and in attempting to
get them I wrote to the Library of Congress for two or three
of them and was told they were so rare
they could not be sent
to me. At the time I knew nothing of microfilms or the
cheapness of getting them. If I had known, I would have had
them microfilm those books but I could not afford the more
expensive reproduction processes and no one suggested it to
me.

At the same time if such films could be made, I
would perhaps be the only one who would send in and ask for
the microfilms and it might be necessary to charge me almost
the full price of making the microfilms, but if in some cases
three or four people in various parts of the country might <span style="page" id="page255">[p.255]</span> ask for a rare book, would there not be a possibility of
merely renting them the microfilm? I am suggesting that because
we have thousands, and tens of thousands, of graduate students
who perhaps could use microfilm service but who are not well
enough equipped with money to purchase every microfilm that
they wanted, and perhaps a cooperative service between the local
library and the graduate student and some central organization,
such as the Library of Congress, might work out that problem.

I am merely offering these as suggestions which may
fit into any program of developing a wider and more extensive
use.

MR. VANDERBILT: I speak for a moment from the point
of view of the small special library which is certainly not
the major interest of this group but it has a certain application to future possible bibliofilm-microfilm plants. I am thinking of a staff of a library intended for the purpose of running
one institution which has a ceiling of 20,000 volumes, a ceiling
established because you should be able to run such an institution with 20,000 volumes, but I envisage the possibility of
having available on film perhaps one out of every 100 titles
of books, and perhaps one-third of the periodicals on film.

Our acquisition policy is to put on our shelves
those reference books which are constantly needed, to get <span style="page" id="page256">[p.256]</span> reports from other libraries of the materials which are available in the community or in a very wide circle thereabout,
but to acquire in film form materials which are not available
in the community, which are infrequently used, and which it is
part of our community obligation to acquire for the purpose of
enriching the resources of the community.

To carry through any such program, the small libraries, such as I am interested in, must be backed up by exceedingly large supporting organizations. Such a program would
be unthinkable without a local union catalogue. Beyond the
union catalogue, there must be a national network of union
catalogues. It would almost be unthinkable without an excellent
bibliographic organization, a subject bibliographic organization,
so that a person approaching a small library from a subject
standpoint is not limited to what we may have acquired or the
community has haphazardly acquired, but what the bibliographic
scholars have chosen to list in their works. We can't do it
without the help of the Wilson Bibliographic Index, for
instance, and I can't think of a completed program without a
sound and now non-existent list of bibliographies even to
the time the Wilson Index began.

I am especially interested in the small library for
people who are not engaged in publication so much as in planning 

## p. 257 (#525) ############################################

action, and the smaller library which is trying to do
the immense job is limited only by the entire earth, provided
time and a very limited expenditure of money for correspondence
and purchase of films of single items is available.

MR. TILLEUX: With regard to the possible interlibrary loan of film, of course as the gentleman has already
pointed out, you would have to have some way of distributing
the original cost of the negative. Please don't let me give
you the impression I am harping on WPA, but it so happens we
have taken that up, too. When we make microfilm copies of
newspaper files or of valuable manuscript files, or of basic
information of any type, we write into the requirements that
the sponsor must agree to let us make the negative and two
positive prints. The negative and one positive print, as I
explained yesterday, go to the Library of Congress. On this
last point, whether or not that positive print comes to the
Library I believe is a matter which Dr. Schwegmann still has
to take up with the Librarian, because that immediately involves
housing of the positive print. It immediately involves the
setting up of records for clearing the thing in and out---controls. We permit the second copy of the positive print to
remain, say, in Cleveland, Ohio, and that replaces in use the
newspaper file. In other words, once and for all the necessity <span style="page" id="page258">[p.258]</span> disappears of bringing out the large bound volumes which are
elephantine in size and very heavy, unless it is necessary
through some former film to check the original.

With regard to the fact that that eliminates
reference, I may point out my understanding is that it has
completely ended inter-library loans in Germany, that all of
the volumes desired are microfilmed, developed at one developing agency and sent out almost immediately. They aren't
troubled with that system of bookkeeping and expense for postage
any more.

The positive copy of the microfilm which we send
to the Library of Congress is to be retained here in a gradually growing pool of microfilm newspaper files so that
scholar in any part of the United States, or for that matter
in the world, who desires some very difficult-to-obtain issue,
or run of a year or more, of a particular title, may make out
an inter-library loan request at his local library and in due
time receive it under government frank from Washington.

MR. KELLAR: I think we are all agreed on the desirability of much wider use of microphotography than is true
at the present time. Dr. Tate has pointed out that the actual
status is that it has not been used to anywhere near the extent
that it can and probably will be. <span style="page" id="page259">[p.259]</span>

One factor in that which has not been mentioned is
that many institutions have preferred not to buy cameras and
reading devices because the evolution of the art has been so
rapid that what was a good instrument a year ago is obsolete a
year later. I think that condition is now being stabilized
and from this time on there will be available a number of good
reading machines and a number of good cameras.
I think one
function possibly of the Continuation Committee and whatever
agency is set up would be to make that knowledge available.

With regard to the increase of the use of microfilms,
I would like to add my word to what Dr. Tate has said about the
desirability of training graduate students in the use of microphotography. In one or two institutions there is a beginning
in that, but it should be very widely extended throughout all
the leading institutions in the United States.

With regard to the self-supporting idea, I would like
to see whatever agency is set up to carry on this work direct
letters and other literature to heads of responsible institutions in this country asking assistance in carrying out such a
program. Make them acquainted with it, tell them what we
are trying to do and enlist their assistance, and perhaps we
will get something in the way of financial aid. I think also
you get a certain assistance to the people in the institutions <span style="page" id="page260">[p.260]</span> who are interested in this and would also aid perhaps in getting
further instruction in the use of microphotography.

MR. JAMESON: Mr. Chairman, I merely want to underscore what Mr. Kellar has said. In my visits this winter
I think I would name even now a dozen college presidents who
are ignorant of microfilming, who are planning or hoping to
build new libraries with microfilming facilities in them,
and who constantly asked me where they could get materials.
I hope the Continuation Committee will answer that.

MR. EVANS: One idea has come to my mind that may be
foolish, I am not sure. It comes to mind in connection with
Mr. Davis' statement that the filming of scientific publication
would have value in the national defense program. If that be
true---and I would not challenge it---might we not dip into
some of the $100,000,000 which the President has in his hip
pocket for use or expenditure as he may see fit in sponsoring
the national defense program?

In that connection also it seems to me that the stand
of the Army Medical Library is very significant, that it will
be glad to pay for the negative of material filmed in the field
of medicine.

I am wondering also if the Department of Agriculture
in connection with the Chinese manuscripts and unique books <span style="page" id="page261">[p.261]</span> mentioned last night would not be willing to purchase some of
the materials of that character. Also these million dollar
research laboratories that are being set up over the country
might wish to bear a considerable proportion of the cost of
materials useful to them. On the whole it seems to me quite
encouraging that we have a number of sources of support for
this enterprise.

There is one more question that I would like to see discussed.
It has been raised very sharply in connection with
the work of the Library of Congress to assist members of the
Congress and their constituents, when the requests of the constituents are forwarded through the members of Congress, and
that is the question of how far a public institution may go
in furnishing copies of material which would be available
through private channels, the question which Mr. Schwegmann
raised. I wonder if Mr. Power who has had some experience in
a commercial enterprise could give us his point of view on
that question, Mr. Chairman.

MR. POWER: I am not sure that I can give you what
you want. I think my organization represents the only laboratory here at least that is self-supporting; not self-supporting
perhaps, but that has built itself up and has equipped itself
without outside aid. In doing so, we have necessarily had to <span style="page" id="page262">[p.262]</span> sacrifice somewhat in appearance and make some equipment ourselves. However, I think in any question of copying in general
you have got to establish it on the basis that it will support
itself, and I see no reason to believe that an organization
perhaps that is endowed can necessarily operate any less expensively than one that maintains itself. In the end the costs
will be the same---they should be---and I should like simply to
leave that with you.

I anticipated sometime ago something of the sort that
has been discussed here and it was with that in view that we
tried to establish a service in Europe whereby scholars could
order the things they want and by which if necessary large
blocks of material could be copied. In the event any large-scale copying is done, I should like to offer the services of
that organization for what they are worth.

MR. SCHWEGMANN: I brought to the front this whole
question of commercial competition because it is going to be
inevitable. By the way, when I spoke of different philosophies
of administration of photocopying services, I meant only to
suggest such services as have not been fully self-supporting;
that difference has not been the result of the difference in
price. I think the price structures of all of these photocopying organizations
are practically the same. It is the <span style="page" id="page263">[p.263]</span> degree of service you give for the amount of money you take in.
I can't help but allude to it in cold business terms because
I am entrusted with the administration of the Library of
Congress photoduplication service. It operates strictly
through a revolving fund. I must put into it as much as I take
out, so I can't view the situation very closely without the
very practical monetary consideration there.

Whether it be Bibliofilm Service, American Documentation Institute or any organization, if we continue to build
up collections of negatives there will be the inevitable call
for positive copies. Other organizations, commercial organizations, are in a similar field. To take an example, the Library
of Congress will receive the microfilm negatives produced by the
WPA. What shall we do with them when calls come for the reproduction of a positive copy? You can't do it for a base price
that will enable you to break exactly even. As a matter of
fact, I definitely suggest that a very small profit, if you
could refer to it as profit, accrue to that transaction so
that through the revolving funds that profit can be used to
produce still further negatives and at the same time preserve
material.
That would be the real thing in view.

I think it is this type of thing Mr. MacLeish wanted
to get some expression of opinion on: What would be the thought <span style="page" id="page264">[p.264]</span> of the majority here as to the operation of such a service---that is, once you have acquired a negative, to service additional positives from it?

MR. HILL: Mr. Chairman, Mr. Tate has spoken about
the use of microfilm, as I understand it, through the reading
machine. The individual scholar probably doesn't have a reading machine. I am afraid that I grew up so long before microfilm that I am not much interested in reading it that way. The
Library of Congress of course has provided enlargement of most
of the film that was taken in Europe, and last night Mr. Power
mentioned the development of the cheaper type of enlargements.
I think that ought to go in the record, and I would like to have
Mr. Power speak to that, if he will.

MR. POWER: I think it is perfectly possible that
the future of microfilm, the future development of it and the
future extensive use by the individual scholar, will take the
line of an inexpensive paper print. There are several things
in the offing which might indicate that. Last night we discussed some of them, the Boni process, the RCA process, the
possibility of using acetate, the possibility of photographic
enlargements made on a continuous enlarger. All of those things
are coming along. I know we can now produce a 6 x 8 print for
about six cents apiece from a microfilm negative, and if the <span style="page" id="page265">[p.265]</span> material is not too large, not too bulky, then it is possible
to use that rather than the reading machine.

MR. WATSON DAVIS: Mr. Chairman, could I speak to the
question of utilization of microfilm? From the experience which
Bibliofilm Service has had, I think you will find that individuals will use both methods, microfilm or photoprints or enlargements, but one interesting thing did happen in the early
days of Bibliofilm Service. You remember that through the
enthusiasm of Dr. Seidell and Miss Barnett and Dr. Draeger
Bibliofilm Service came into being to meet a need of supplanting inter-library loan, and it came into being before there
was any adequate reading machine available at all. As a matter
of fact, I counseled very strongly in the early days, as Dr.
Seidell will remember: Wait and do not operate until a reading
machine is available. But very happily that counsel was not
taken and Bibliofilm Service did start off sending to research
men who had never heard of microfilm these little strips of
film.

The amazing and interesting thing about it was that
if the man wanted to use the material that was on the film, he
figured out some way to read it. He used a dissecting microscope, he rigged up his own enlarging devices, and so forth.
If the desire to use the material is great enough, the scholar <span style="page" id="page266">[p.266]</span> and the research man will read the film.

Now we are beyond that stage. You can get a reading
machine for the price of a typewriter. You may be able to get
a reading machine within a few months within half the price of
a portable typewriter. We are undoubtedly going to have
various kinds of utilization of microfilm, that is, through
the enlarged print, which incidentally Bibliofilm Service
sells at ten cents regularly, or through low-price reading
machines. I think we can be sure that the scholar, once he
sees the usefulness of the microfilm method, will be able to
utilize it, and as a great contribution to scholarship it seems
to me that we should as a group and through our continuing
committee, carry on the necessary educational campaign by all
means possible to acquaint the scholars and the research men
of the country with the facilities that microfilm does bring
them.

MR. SWINGLE: Mr. Chairman, I might mention that
a few years ago at a conference there was discussion of the
question of interesting libraries in microfilm, and a very
prominent librarian said, "I am not in favor of it," and
partly to get around his objection, Dr. Draeger and his
assistants worked all night and made a dummy volume with about
twenty pages of good-sized bibliofilm.
The entire text is <span style="page" id="page267">[p.267]</span> there (displaying dummy volume), 60 pages to a folio; that is,
ten of these leaves would cover 600 pages. Six thousand pages
would take only 100 of those. That dummy goes on the shelf
of the library in the proper place with other editions of the
same work. The title is legibly enlarged. It has the table
of contents in full. This small paper print can be read with a
small magnifying glass, not to read but to see whether this
edition happens to have something of interest to the person
who is looking at it. This comes on with a self-lighting
lens like you use for navigators' charts. You can pick it
up off a dark shelf and look at it, you don't need to take it
away from the shelf to do that. When he finds something he
wants, then he presses the button and has the film put on the
projector and reads it. Meantime, there is the book on the
shelf and here is protection against the little worms in boxes.
This happens to be Chinese, a very rare Chinese book.

CO-CHAIRMAN LYDENBERG: It is instructive to see
how we have been paying attention to the service to the individual scholar in the recent development of our talk.

MR. SEIDELL: May I speak just once more? I dislike
very much this idea of self-support. It may be very bad to
say so, but I feel that public funds support libraries to serve
people who can improve conditions of mankind. Well, how shall <span style="page" id="page268">[p.268]</span> we select those whom we serve? I think we can trust those who
are willing to try to serve humanity to receive and be given
all the support they can, so I would like to think that the
time will come when libraries will look upon the use of microfilm as as much a part of their duty of expenditure of public
funds as having the book there ready for somebody who can come
and look at it and wants to take the trouble to do so. It
is just a perfection of a means, I always say, to advance research. I never think of the scholar because I happen to be a
chemist who works in the laboratory and I only see it from my
standpoint. I look upon it from the point of view of a man
engaged in research. Every instant that he loses from his desk
going to the library to look up something is just that much
energy wasted so far as research is concerned, so I think we
must try as far as we can to try to separate microfilm activities into two parts. One part is distinctly acquisitions for
libraries, you obtain these things, and that is the idea of
most of you here; most of you are connected with institutions or
libraries and most of you want to collect things and have them
ready for people to use. Naturally, you have to buy books for
the library; that is well established; you get appropriations
for that service. You must buy those things and the selections
must be made by someone skilled in that field. <span style="page" id="page269">[p.269]</span>

After you have paid money, public funds, to buy it and
you have got it in the library, then microfilm offers a means
to perfect the service that libraries render. I am trying
very hard at the present time to have the Library of the
Department of Agriculture actually support the efforts of the
microfilm laboratory in supplying their research people not
only in Washington, in Bethesda and Beltsville where a large
number of their research men are presently located, but these
various units throughout the country. They, themselves, will
furnish the money and consequently they will furnish all the
films free to every one of the men in the government service.
That will establish a principle. After we have gotten that
well established that the government shall support its own
people in that way, then eventually we will be supporting the
experiment stations and the land-grant colleges and we will get
to some of the rest of them. So eventually I look forward to
the time when microfilm service, as far as this library is
concerned, will be supported directly by public funds in the
same way that the service of books is supported at the present
time.

CO-CHAIRMAN LYDENBERG: That is certainly a very impressive ideal to set before us.

May I ask if you have any suggestion on No. 14, as to <span style="page" id="page270">[p.270]</span> how we may coordinate the operations---not the needs, the
active operations---of the individual scholars?

MR. BEMIS: If the Library of Congress accepts the
direction of this work, I should say that would be the ideal
coordination of everything.

CO-CHAIRMAN LELAND: Mr. Chairman, perhaps what the
person who endeavored to compose this agenda had in mind when
he put that question was something like this. A great many
individual scholars, as all aid-granting agencies know, apply
for grants-in-aid in order to enable them to secure material
which they now secure largely in the form of microfilm because
they can secure much more for the same amount, and usually
some provision is attached to the grant that when the material
is secured with their aid and has been used by the scholar
who has been able to secure it, that it should be held at the
disposal of other scholars.

In the case of the Modern Language Association and
its cooperative arrangement with the Library of Congress, there
is a definite pool established in the Library of Congress, a
constantly growing pool of material of a great diversity of
nature, of course composed mostly of fairly short pieces---that
is to say there are no very long runs in it---which is made up
in just that way. It is made up of materials secured for <span style="page" id="page271">[p.271]</span> individual scholars for their particular needs but exists as
a general pool, as a national asset, and parts of it are
available for other scholars who may want to use it after the
use has been finished by the scholar for whose use it was
secured.

But that touches only a small part of the materials
that are secured by American scholars. That handles those in
literature and in the fields of the modern languages. There
must be a vast amount of material that is being secured all the
time by individual scholars. Mr. Danton spoke about the case
of the gentleman who went about the country filming farm diaries
and things of that sort, and produced film, not very successful
from the point of view of technic, but at the same time valuable
from the point of view of content. What becomes of that? Does
it get into a place where it can be used by the public? I
think that there is a problem there that has got to be taken
into consideration in order that the results of a great many
individual efforts shall not be wasted or lost by having their
use confined to the person who makes the film or for whom the
film is secured.

MR. BUCK: Mr. Chairman, in that connection I should
like to point out that the same problem develops when an institution makes microcopies of material in its possession for <span style="page" id="page272">[p.272]</span> individual scholars scattered all over the country, and those
copies may be preserved but would be so scattered that they
would not serve any general purposes. At the National Archives
we have been considering the desirability of establishing the
precedent that whenever any considerable body of material in
our custody is to be reproduced for a scholar, we would not
send the negative to the scholar but would preserve the negative
ourselves and make a positive for the scholar, and thus by
this more or less continuous process of reproducing for individuals build up in the National Archives a collection of negatives of archival materials which could be used for the making
of additional positives for others who might be interested, or
could be used in the National Archives in the place of the
originals.

I should like to speak on another point which comes
perhaps more properly in our next discussion but I have to
leave shortly and our archivist, Mr. Connor, asked me to bring
one matter to the attention of this group. The problem of
storage of materials is of course going to be a serious one
if any very extensive body of microcopies is acquired. Possibly the microcopies will be distributed around to various
libraries, but there seems to be a feeling on the part of many
that some sort of central pool, at least for negatives, would <span style="page" id="page273">[p.273]</span> be desirable. In that connection, the Archivist wanted me to
state that plans have been under consideration for a number of
years for the construction of a government building, probably
in the outskirts of Washington, for the purpose of housing film.
The National Archives, as most of you know, confines its acquisitions in the field of paper materials to the records of
the Federal Government, but under the act establishing the
National Archives there are two fields in which it is authorized to go outside of official documentation, the fields of
motion pictures and sound recordings. We are interested here
primarily in the motion picture field because that also involves
film and the National Archives is building up an extensive collection of motion picture film that includes not merely film
that could be considered as a part of the archives of the Federal Government, film produced or acquired by agencies of the
Federal Government, but also gifts of motion picture film received from a wide variety of sources. Such gifts are supposed
to have some relation to American history but that is interpreted very broadly to cover almost anything that seems to be
desirable.

That collection is being built up in the National
Archives at the present time, but special equipment and facilities are necessary for adequate preservation, especially, of <span style="page" id="page274">[p.274]</span> course, for the nitrate type, but I understand even cellulose
film requires special care in order to insure its preservation.

Sometime ago it was evident that this collection,
if it was expanded as was apparently intended by the original
act setting up the National Archives, would in the course of
time certainly outgrow the facilities available in the National
Archives Building, and plans were therefore made for the erection of a large building for the storage of film somewhere in
the outskirts of Washington. Such a building might, it seems
to me, be devoted in part to the storage of microfilms, copies
of still material or any other kind of film, because the
physical conditions of storage for still film are of course
identical with those for the storage of motion picture film.
That project has gone to the point where plans have been drawn
up by Procurement and I understand that it has definitely been
placed on the President's schedule of his ten-year plan for
public buildings in Washington. Of course that doesn't mean
that money has been appropriated for it, but it is in the
routine of development and should be taken into consideration,
I think, by the Continuation Committee in any discussion of
storage facilities for a great central pool of microfilms.

MR. TILLEUX: Who absorbs the additional cost of
the microfilm made for scholars? You say you retain the <span style="page" id="page275">[p.275]</span> original.

MR. BUCK: What I said was that we are discussing a
plan for doing this. Actually, that plan has not yet been put
into operation. My own personal feeling is that the positive
should be sold at a price that will absorb part of the cost of
the negative with the thought that in case there is the sale
of another positive, that will also cover part of the cost
of the negative. I think the thing could be apportioned
roughly in such a way as to take care of the situation.

CO-CHAIRMAN LYDENBERG: That brings us very neatly
into No. 17 under VI. It is instructive to see that National
Archives has had foresight enough to see the necessity of pooling this. May I ask if any of the others have any comments
to make on that particular phase of the problem?

MR. CASE: Mr. Chairman, what Dr. Buck has just described has raised a question which we have skirted around to
some extent during these discussions. I am not entirely clear
as to the intended function of the central agency which would
coordinate the want lists and the effectuation of the various
parts of the program of microcopying.
If it is to serve fundamentally as a clearing house for the projects which are proposed by individual institutions, and which are to be undertaken by those institutions, and ultimately to be serviced by <span style="page" id="page276">[p.276]</span> those institutions, in cooperation with others, that is one
kind. If it is to take over not only the advisory and clearing
house capacity, but also the operating and servicing functions
as well, that is entirely different.

I should like to have some definition of the intent
of that agency discussed here.

CO-CHAIRMAN LELAND: Mr. Chairman, that is of course
a very important question. I think it is very hard to think
through it completely. I suppose we can hardly conceive of
some single agency doing all these things, but I do think
that whatever national agency may be set up, it probably
would do something of both of those things. In other words,
it should serve as a clearing house, because I think the discussion since yesterday noon shows very clearly the necessity
of maintaining accurate information with regard to enterprises, and making that information available. That is
largely what a clearing house is.

When it comes to operating large-scale projects on
a national basis, it is quite conceivable that a central agency
might assume the operation of those, assume the operating of
making the films, of storing them, of servicing them through
whatever national agency might be selected for that, say the
Library of Congress or the National Archives for storage <span style="page" id="page277">[p.277]</span> purposes or some other national agency.
In other words, I
think the Continuation Committee has got to consider the possibility of the central agency, the central committee, doing a
good many quite different things, that it isn't necessary to
have only a clearing house or to have only a central operating
and servicing agency. Probably the two things will have to go
along together.

MR. CASE: Mr. Chairman, I don't want at this late
date to get into too deep a controversy over that, but it does
seem to me that the individual needs over a long period of the
separate institutions have got to be kept in mind. Libraries
which have special collections and special facilities in given
fields, which have devoted a good deal of money and a good deal
of experience to bringing those fields to a point of excellence
that is remarkable and notable in a section of the country, or
indeed in the entire country, would feel, I suppose, that they
could depend on their continued justification of existence by
adopting the new technics of microcopying, not only to maintain
their place relatively, but to increase their usefulness.

I should imagine that you could count on a great
deal of eagerness and initiative if those institutions felt
that projects which they developed could, within the framework
of a clearing house and within the framework of agencies <span style="page" id="page278">[p.278]</span> by which complete cooperation and servicing could be accomplished to the satisfaction of scholars, still that they might
serve as the depository, as the servicing agent of their own
projects.

CO-CHAIRMAN LELAND: Mr. Chairman, I think that is
a very good statement of exactly what I have in mind. It
is stated much more clearly than I stated it myself. Obviously,
these enterprises, especially of institutions that we have
heard of today, the Folger Library, the Huntington Library,
other institutions that have plans, projects and so forth, will,
we should hope, be encouraged and perhaps assisted in developing projects. The important function of a central agency would
be to maintain a sort of clearance of those projects so the
scholarly world at large would know what those institutions
were doing and what they could ask of them. In other words,
they would be encouraged to go on in the work they were doing,
and if the several agencies could facilitate that in any way,
so much the better.

MR. MacLEISH: I think I see what the gentleman has
in mind. I think the thing he fears is something he needn't
fear; at least I shouldn't think he needs fear it. I think
this matter revolves closely about the item that is numbered
16, and which seems to me to be so basic to this whole matter <span style="page" id="page279">[p.279]</span> that perhaps it ought not even to be discussed in these last
few minutes, but perhaps I can take two minutes to say why I
think it is basic.

It seems to me that the development of microfilm
offers a great deal more than a mechanism for extending service
to scholars. I think it offers a means by which the responsibility for building up collections can be so divided throughout
the country or throughout areas in the country that we may be
quite hopeful of arriving eventually at the point where the
resources for scholarship in the country will be adequate to
the demands. That can be done by assuring the acceptance of
responsibility by those libraries which have specialized in
particular fields. I can't conceive that it would be impossible to arrive at some such solution. I don't believe that
egoism or the vanity of librarians is what it is supposed to
be, in that they stand upon their possessions or they are
afraid someone will get in their door. I can't believe that is
true. The problem is to make the resources of the country
adequate. That can only be done by dividing responsibility.
Microfilm offers a means of arriving at that end. So it seems
to me it is absolutely basic to this whole proposal that
sometime, somewhere, we develop a system of division of responsibility. Once that is done, a central unit such as we have in <span style="page" id="page280">[p.280]</span> mind, which would be nothing but a clearing house to receive
inquiries, forward them and fill them, would step on nobody's
toes and get in nobody's way and be a useful thing. Until
that is done, I can see difficulties.

CO-CHAIRMAN LYDENBERG: Thank you, Mr. MacLeish.
May I add to your two minutes. I see I am going to anticipate
what Mr. Downs undoubtedly was planning to say, namely, that
the Board on Resources of the American Library Association has
long realized the responsibility of joint action in that respect, and has under Dr. Bishop and Mr. Downs gone far in
formulating policies by which the rivalry of libraries may be
healthy rather than destructive, and the general object of
librarianship as an aid to scholarship and research may be
improved rather than developed into any petty jealousies. I
am sorry, Mr. Downs, I took the words out of your mouth, but I
felt so strongly as Mr. MacLeish expressed that he had anticipated what I know you had long planned for.

MR. DOWNS: At this time I would like to add just a
few words to that. I think these agreements between libraries
are entirely practical things. There are many such agreements existing in the country at the present time, usually
in rather limited areas, Chicago, Cincinnati, Boston, several
southern centers, in which collecting agreements exist among <span style="page" id="page281">[p.281]</span> the libraries. I have had some experience in working out such
agreements. They can be done on two or three bases. One is
by subjects, either minute or very broad subjects; another
is by forms of material, such as public documents, newspapers,
general periodicals and several other categories. Those agreements are most successful, I think, if they are based on the
present holdings of the institutions. For example, it is
best to assign a particular library a subject for intensive
development in which it is already strong. It is also desirable to take into account the research interests, teaching
interests, of the particular institution, because those are the
lines along which it wants to develop.

Another point to consider is that all agreements
should be positive, that no institution should be asked to
give up anything, but always to assume responsibilities. The
Union Catalogue here at the Library of Congress now has a
great deal of information about special collections over the
country that could be used as a foundation for these agreements, and the Board on Resources is making a study of it
in about seventy-five subject fields all over the country.
That is being made up with the advice of several hundred subject
specialists scattered over the country. There is a great
deal of duplication of interest in these collecting activities

## p. 282 (#575) ############################################

and I think it is highly desirable that agreements of this
sort be reached.

MR. CASE: If I may transgress on your time for one
more word on this subject, there are now fairly well recognized
scholarly centers of research in given fields, and it seems to
me that we should recognize that microfilm material is most
valuably used, most fruitfully used, as supplementary to the
original books and documents and other materials held in
libraries. It was, therefore, not with any idea of increasing
rivalry or jealousy on the part of librarians of special
collections, but simply of developing those fields which now
exist to their utmost usefulness, and I should hope that the
sense of this group might be to recommend to the Continuation
Committee that it adopt the policy of building upon existing
strength where it now does exist, and that the depository and
the servicing agency should again be within this frame of the
production of the clearing house, first, and then of agencies
for lending and servicing materials, but building upon the
existing structure of present collections.

MR. CARRUTHERS: Just one word on that. I think the
problem could be resolved very nicely by the use of duplicate
negatives. You have your original negative in the central
depository and the duplicate negative in the special collection. <span style="page" id="page283">[p.283]</span>

MR. TILLEUX: I think it would be indeed unfortunate
if this very, very interesting conference were to close without
our expressing the thanks of the body to the Librarian of
Congress for the very commodious quarters and the very fine
spirit in which he has received us, to the Cosmos Club for
similar quarters and the fine food of which we partook, and
particularly to the foundations which have made our visit
here possible.

I would like at this time to make two suggestions.
I don't know that it is in the record anywhere that we have
not covered all the existing facilities for duplication. While
this is essentially a microfilm conference, there are other
methods, as you probably know, some of which are not particularly highly thought of when we think of duplicating records but
perhaps they have qualities of which we are not aware.

One is the Carter method of photographing on metal,
that is, polished aluminum alloy. What is wrong with that
method? Perhaps it has possibilities. Then there is also the
Hunter Electro Copyist which is essentially a photostating
device. You put your original here (demonstrating), a sheet of
photostat paper on the top, close the lid, the clock ticks away
for a few seconds, the lid flies up and you have your copy. <span style="page" id="page284">[p.284]</span> The advantage is you can develop that within a moment or two at
that point and then you know whether your print is any good.
It is also advantageous in that it is no heavier than a portable
typewriter. In other words, let's read into the record that
there are other systems, some advanced by filing companies.

Third, I should like to suggest one thing we ought
to do is to write on the American Council of Learned Society's
letterhead to the various camera manufacturers, Eastman, Zeiss-Ikon, Agfa, Argus, and the others, and ask if they would mind
letting us have a complete list of purchasers of microfilm
cameras. There are undoubtedly lots of them scattered all over
the world of which we are not aware, and which are latent points
at which we could secure microfilming if it were necessary.
For example, we know where all the Draeger cameras are.
I believe Lieutenant Draeger has one at Tientsin, China, now, in
addition to the one at Peiping.
Poleman of the Library of
Congress was mentioned yesterday without being named, as having
a Photorecord
in India that he plans to leave there.

Then we ought to plan a list of all the microfilming
firms in America and in Europe, such as Gaevert in Belgium,
Systeme Lizy in France, Kohlux in Berne, Kontophot and
Fotokopist in Berlin, Foto-Clark in Bonn, the Sellmannfilms
in Stockholm. We ought to write to these firms and to all the <span style="page" id="page285">[p.285]</span> various learned societies and libraries doing microfilming
there, explain what we have been doing, if necessary send them
complete drafts of our proceedings, let them know we recognize
their scholarly ability, that we want to cooperate, that we
need help and they can give it. I have in mind the Preussische
Staatsbibliothek in Berlin, the Federation Internationale
de Documentation, the office
Internationale de Chimie and
the Institut de Recherche et d'Histoire des Textes.

CO-CHAIRMAN LYDENBERG: I wonder if it would not be
just as well to offer those detailed suggestions to the
Continuation Committee, with power to expand them.

May I ring the bell for the home stretch and ask if
the Reporter is in position to give us in fifteen seconds the
summary of our deliberations of fifteen hours.

MR. TATE: The Reporter is unfortunately not in a
position to give you anything other than a few comments on the
sessions thus far. Briefly, the questions of publication, list
of sources, information centers, methods of progress, were discussed yesterday morning. A resolution was offered to the
effect that when libraries secure full-scale or microfilm
reproductions of important printed texts, a proper catalogue
card should be made and sent to the Union Catalogue of the
Library of Congress. This was later extended to include <span style="page" id="page286">[p.286]</span> past copies.

The various problems relating to the production and
use of film were discussed in greater or lesser detail. A
great many methods of making such copies were read into the
record.

Last evening the discussion revolved principally about
large-scale projects and processes. A great deal of detailed
information and very valuable information, incidentally, was
offered on various projects and programs which have taken place
or which are in progress. My notes here show a great deal of,
I should say, information available nowhere else was gathered
from the experiences of those attending the conference.

To review briefly this morning, the discussion of
want lists, their compilation, the formulation of a central
union catalogue, the completion of the Union Catalogue as a tool
to service want lists, the great difficulty of determining
wants, the two points of view toward an emergency program intended for immediate operation, a long-range program over a
period of time, were brought up. Again the importance of rapid
procedure in the selection of fields are particularly stressed.
There were a number of queries: One of them, how to utilize
the possibilities of selection and other machinery? What body
shall formulate and coordinate the program, carry it out? The <span style="page" id="page287">[p.287]</span> Continuation Committee was instructed to investigate this
technically and also to determine what machinery might be set
up. The suggestion of the incorporation of the Bibliofilm
Service with the Library of Congress service was made, and
followed by certain discussion. It was mentioned that the WPA
might welcome suggestions on how their clerical program could
help to fill gaps in the Union Catalogue.

The question of funds of course was discussed. The
inclusion of the American Council of Learned Societies and the
S.S.R.C. was suggested and passed to the Continuation Committee. Practical questions of money, funds for the program, were
briefly considered.

The very important question of material gathered by
the individual scholar, and how it might be preserved and made
generally available, was passed to the Continuation Committee.
The final major point, I believe, was that of the query: Is
the proposed agency to become a clearing house and/or a
servicing unit?

The preliminary appointments to the Continuation
Committee were Mr. Metcalf as Chairman, Mr. Lydenberg, Mr.
Kellar, Mr. MacLeish, Mr. Stewart, Mr. Schwegmann and Mr. Tate
were announced by the Co-Chairman.

CO-CHAIRMAN LYDENBERG: I am sure Mr. Tilleux' <span style="page" id="page288">[p.288]</span> suggestion of a vote of thanks to the Librarian of Congress,
the American Council of Learned Societies, the Cosmos Club and
to the others who have joined to make this conference possible,
calls for no formal action. Our gratitude is spontaneous and
sincere, and with your permission I will ask that the minutes
of the meeting contain that record.

... Announcement regarding expense vouchers ...

CO-CHAIRMAN LYDENBERG: Have you any other comments,
Dr. Leland?

CO-CHAIRMAN LELAND: No, except on behalf of the
Council of Learned Societies I want to thank you all for the
time and trouble you have taken to attend this conference and
the attention you have given it.
Some of you have come a long
distance, about as long a distance as you can travel in the
United States without jumping off, and we are very grateful to
you for coming. The Council itself is very grateful to the
Rockefeller Foundation for having made this conference
possible, and we shall do our best to see that in the course of
time an adequate report of these proceedings is placed in your
hands, and of course your names will be kept on a list and
any reports that the Continuation Committee may make will be
sent to you in due time. In other words, you will be kept informed as to the results of this conference. The information <span style="page" id="page289">[p.289]</span> may not reach you as promptly as you would like; doubtless you
would like to have full information by the time you reach home
but in the course of the summer you will receive these reports
and documents and we will try to keep you informed.

This conference is not a continuing body and therefore when it adjourns today it comes to an end, but the result
of it I am sure will continue and I am sure it will have
permanent results and that out of it will come doubtless a
great improvement in the situation we have been discussing, and
I hope real solutions of some of the problems that have been
presented. It is a conference which adjourns without definite
resolutions or recommendations or findings, leaving everything
in the hands of this Continuation Committee, but the discussions I think have provided a large body of information and of
suggestions and of other information for the Continuation
Committee and will be of great service to it.

Finally, I want to thank you in the name of the
Council for having come here.

... The meeting adjourned at twelve-forty o'clock...
